    "title": "Destination dupes: Where to go instead of the US",
    "content": "As a number of countries issue updated travel advisory information for travel to the US amid tightened restrictions, where can travellers find a similar vibe?\nCitizens of Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and the UK have all heard the same thing in the past few months: if you're planning to travel to the US, the situation has changed. All six governments have issuedupdated travel advicefollowing recent policy changes, drawing attention to a tightening of entry rules and the need for transgender people to declare themselves as male or female on Esta and visa applications.\nAs a result, sentiment is shifting around travel to the Land of the Free.Reports of travellers being detainedat the border over misunderstandings, along with a disturbing spate ofair traffic control failures, have done nothing to increase confidence among travellers. So if you're drawn to the bold landscapes, cultural energy and cinematic atmosphere of the US but are reconsidering your travel plans this year– where can you go instead? From cowboy ranches to vibrant cities and deep canyons, these international alternatives echo the best of the US, with a twist.\nThere's no place like the Big Apple –  or is there? Toronto has long served as a convincing on screen stand-in, doubling for New York in film and television thanks to its eclectic architecture and versatile landscapes along with favourable film-industry incentives. It's so convincing a dupe that it even passed as the city in the Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong filmThe Apprentice, charting Donald Trump's rise to fame in 1970s and '80s Manhattan.\nOf course Toronto is a different and far smaller city to visit: you'll find the Blue Jays not the Yankees on the baseball field here, and a city-wide devotion to poutine, not pizza. However, the parallels run deep. High Park – a 400-acre park with hiking trails and cherry trees – evokes the grandeur of Central Park; while the CN Tower delivers a skyline view to rival the Empire State Building. Even its history aligns: from 1793-1834, Toronto wasn't even called Toronto, it was called York.\n\"Actor Peter Ustinov famously said that Toronto is New York run by the Swiss,\" said Lydia Devereaux, international marketing director at Destination Ontario. \"We've both got world-class museums and galleries, shopping, a renowned food scene inspired by an incredibly diverse population and unique walkable neighbourhoods.\"\nYellowstone has a lot to answer for. The popular Paramount show – along with spin off show 1888 and Beyoncé'sCowboy Carterworld tour – is behind what travel experts have called the rise incowboy core: a growing interest in Western culture, ranch stays and horse-riding holidays. But while Montana and Wyoming are seeing new interest, you don’t have to be in the US to experience the best of cowboy culture: just ask thegauchos(cowboys) of Argentina.\nHere, gaucho culture draws on a centuries-old heritage of nomadic horsemen who care for their livestock and live life in the saddle. While this traditional lifestyle is struggling to survive in the face of agricultural advancement, travellers can stay in a wide array ofestancia(Argentine gaucho ranches) where the pace is slow, the landscapes are vast and the asado (traditional barbecue) is serious business.\n\"AtEstancia Los Potreros, guests witness authentic horsemanship, asados andmatedrinking, which are all still part of daily life,\" said owner Kevin Begg, who believes the Argentinian version of cowboy culture is even more authentic than the US. \"We invite our guests to be part of our family and our activities are all based on what is going on at the estancia as opposed to being picked off an activity list.\"\nThe Grand Canyon's size and scale are unmatched – measuring 278 miles long, 18 miles across at its widest and an average of one mile deep. Its also one of the US'smost visited national parks, with nearly five million visitors last year.\nBut Europe's deepest canyon, the Tara River Gorge in Montenegro, offers a similar sense of awe, without the crowds. Located inDurmitor National Park, the canyon is carved by a ribbon of turquoise-blue water, where whitewater rafters brace for roiling waves beneath sharp-sided cliffs.\n\"It has a powerful sense of isolation and raw beauty that will resonate with anyone who has stood at the edge of the Grand Canyon,\" said Stefanie Schmudde, senior vice president of global product strategy at luxury travel specialistsAbercrombie & Kent. \"The scale is immense, and it offers that same visceral connection to nature in a setting that feels remote and undiscovered.\"\nFrom its famous fog to the Golden Gate Bridge, Silicon Valley and Alcatraz, San Francisco is one of the US' most distinctive cities. It has had starring roles in films including Dirty Harry and Mrs Doubtfire, while helping to shape cultural history in the US and beyond thanks to the 1967 Summer of Love protests against the Vietnam War.\nMore like this:\n•'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\n•The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\n•How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\nBut on the other side of the globe, Cape Town in South Africa channels a similar mood – with its fog-draped coast, significant cultural history and a growing tech scene as well as its very own historic prison island.\nRobben Island, where Nelson Mandela was once imprisoned, is now a museum and a fair dupe for Alcatraz, both being surrounded by shark-infested waters. While you won't meet sea lions on a Cape Town beach as you might in San Francisco, there is a colony of African penguins living atBoulder Beach.\n\"Cape Town is one of those places that truly has something for everyone,\" said Zinzi Bobani, general manager of travel firmIntrepid's Southern Africa office. \"It's a foodie haven with a fusion of cuisines and stunning wineries, beautiful coastal hiking routes and cable car adventures on Table Mountain, and of course rich in history.\"\nAsia's gambling hub, Macau, is a former trading port between China, India and Portugal that's known as thecasino capital of the world. If you're looking for an alternative to the bright lights of glitzy desert city Las Vegas, the \"Vegas of Asia\", as the Chinese special administrative region is often called, could be a great fit.\nJust as in Vegas, visitors to Macau can experience shows and fine dining along with resort-style luxury hotels. While Macau may not have aBellagio, it does have the world's firstKarl Lagerfeld Hotel, a five-star hotel designed by the fashion legend. At the Cotai Strip, you can find replicas of Venice's Grand Canal and a half-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower.\nAndy Eastham of travel firmWendy Wu Tourssays it has the Vegas feel and then a little extra: \"For fans of Vegas, there's plenty that will feel familiar, but where Macau really stands apart is in its cultural depth. One moment you're sipping cocktails in a sky bar, the next you're wandering through cobbled lanes lined with pastel-coloured colonial buildings or watching dragon dancers outside a Taoist temple. It's the only place in China where Portuguese and Chinese cultures truly intertwine.\" "

    "title": "I was on a flight - but British Airways told me I wasn't",
    "content": "An extraordinary thing happened to me on a recent flight to Madrid: I unwittingly travelled under the wrong identity, becoming a potential security issue, and no-one realised.\nI was packing for a short business trip to make a film for the BBC when I attempted to check-in online. It didn't work, so I headed to London Heathrow Airport to do it in person.\nUpon arrival there, I tried once again to check myself in, this time at a self-service booth. Again I was denied, the machine flashing up an error code: \"Assistance required.\"\nI ended up at a check-in desk and after checking in my bag, a British Airways staff member handed me a boarding pass. Admittedly I didn't read the pass in any detail, but headed off to get processed in the security area as normal.\nAt the gate, I was among the first passengers to board flight BA7055 departing at 10:50 on 23 April, operated by BA's Spanish partner carrier Iberia, as I was in row six.\nDutifully, I handed my passport and boarding pass to a member of BA ground crew, who glanced at them both and waved me through.\nOnce on board I realised my seat was in business class. I assumed this must have been a free upgrade, because I would of course usually have been in economy; we had chosen this flight because it was the most cost-effective option with all our filming equipment.\nNo sooner were we off the tarmac and at cruising altitude than the delicious baked cod and chickpea stew lunch was served. Tiramisu for dessert, too. No complimentary alcohol for me though; it was a work trip.\nIt was on arrival in the Spanish capital when things started to go wrong.\nAs soon as I gained mobile signal on the ground, an email popped up: my return flight had been cancelled.\nI asked the BBC's travel provider what had happened and what the plan was for getting me home?\nIn response, the travel company said it had been cancelled because I was a no-show on the outbound flight.\nI explained that I was in fact very much in Madrid and waiting - endlessly, it seemed - to collect my checked luggage from the baggage belt.\nAfter some no doubt confusing conversations between our travel team and BA, I received a further message to say the airline was adamant I had not travelled and that the boarding pass in my possession did not display the correct details.\nThis was when I realised that the name on my boarding pass was not mine, it was a man called Huw H. The BBC is not using Huw H's full name, which was printed on the pass.\nHis name was also printed on my luggage tags.\nBA claimed there was no way I could have travelled using that document as security checks wouldn't allow it - but I did. My colleague, who was seated a few rows behind me, can vouch for me being on that plane.\nThe airline was so sure that I was not in Madrid that the BBC had to book me another seat on the flight home I was originally booked onto, at great expense. BA has since offered a £500 goodwill voucher as well as refunding the cost of the extra ticket.\nThe security protocol for passengers boarding flights is relatively simple: ground crew must check the name on the boarding pass matches that on the passport presented.\nThis process appears to have broken down in my case - with no-one at check-in or the boarding gate identifying the discrepancy between the name on the boarding pass and my passport.\nSo what went wrong, and who is Huw H? I tried to find out.\nSome internet sleuthing brought limited proof of Huw H's existence. I made a few attempts to contact accounts using his full name via various social media channels, to no avail. It's made me fear that he might not even exist.\nI did manage to get in touch with someone with a similar name - Jonathan Huw H - who, it turns out, flew on a BA flight on 24 April, a day after mine, landing at Heathrow, so is it possible his name was somehow floating around in the BA system? \"It's really worrying,\" Jonathan told me.\nMy married name, which was on my booking confirmation and passport, begins with the letter H - though is very different to Huw H's surname. Could this have factored in?\nIt's impossible to know, and BA cannot confirm anything for privacy reasons.\nSimon Calder, travel correspondent at the Independent, said it was to be expected that mistakes will sometimes happen \"in the high-pressure, deadline-strewn world of aviation\".\nBut he added: \"This case is unusual in that the error wasn't picked up at the departure gate, where it could have been easily rectified.\n\"The airline needs urgently to investigate and make amends.\"\nAviation security and operations expert Julian Bray added: \"There is a security issue here, in that the plane took off with an incorrect passenger manifest.\n\"It is wrong and shouldn't have happened. The passenger manifest should be correct as it is an important document that shows who is travelling and where. That said, as the name on the baggage tag matched the one on the boarding pass and the correct number of people were on board when the plane took off, I can see how it happened.\"\nOthers would argue that it was not a security risk, though, because both myself and my luggage went through all the usual security checks.\nA spokesperson for BA, which managed my ticket as well as the Heathrow ground crew in my case, said: \"We've contacted our customer to apologise for this genuine human error. While incidents like this are extremely rare, we've taken proactive steps to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"\nMeanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority has told me it has launched an investigation into what happened.\nHeathrow Airport said in response to a request for comment that it was not responsible for the ground crew or anything else in my case, and security screening went ahead as normal.\nIberia, whose only involvement in my journey was operating the outbound plane and cabin crew, has not responded to a request for comment. As is nothing out of the ordinary, my passport and boarding pass were not manually checked on the plane.\nApologies and investigations aside, the question remains how this was ever possible in this day and age of high security.\nOn social media there are threads about this type of thing happening around the world in the past, but the mistake was rectified before take-off as there were two people trying to sit in the same seat.\nWhat happened to me appears to be different as my name was seemingly replaced with someone who seemingly wasn't travelling to Spain that day.\nI'm not sure I'll ever really know what happened, but one thing is for sure - I won't ever walk away from a check-in desk without reading every detail printed on my boarding pass in future.\n"

    "title": "'Food is the thing that grounds them': What happens to family recipes when home no longer exists?",
    "content": "In her new book, Chef Hawa Hassan shares dishes and stories from conflict zones, showing how food can preserve culture, even when so much else is lost.\nWhen Ali Zaman makesUzbeki Kabuli pulao– Afghanistan's national rice and lamb dish – he always adds a splash of toasted sesame oil to enhance the flavour. The New York City coffee-shop owner, whose roots stretch from Queens to Kabul and Maimana, is passionate about sharing the flavours of his heritage. \"Home isn't merely a place on the map,\" he is quoted as saying inSetting a Place for Us, the new book by James Beard Award-winning chef Hawa Hassan. \"It's a feeling that transcends borders.\"\nThat sentiment flows through every page of Hassan's latest work, which explores the powerful connection between food, identity and displacement. Echoing the format of her acclaimed debutIn Bibi's Kitchen, this latest collection combines history, personal stories and traditional recipes from eight countries affected by conflict and displacement, including Yemen, El Salvador, Lebanon and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nFrom the poignant account of a Baghdadi brewer who had to flee his home twice to a recipe for the intoxicating flavours of Egyptianfil fil mahshi(stuffed peppers), the book chronicles the stories and dishes people carry with them when war, disaster or exile forces them to leave everything else behind, while exploring the larger question of how food helps ground people in times of trouble.\nBBC Travel spoke to the Somali-American chef and author about documenting diaspora through food, what she learned from the people she interviewed and what it means to set a place at the table for cultures often left out of the story.\nThere are now so many places around the world where people have been displaced through conflict and disaster. How did you choose which places to represent in the book?\nI always tell people that I picked them because I also wanted to examine my own story and what that looked like, but the truth is that I chose these countries based on conflict and instability, humanitarian concern, and then, lastly, historical and cultural significance. Despite their struggles, these nations hold such deep-rooted parts of our own history. I wanted to talk about the cradle of civilisation in Iraq; I wanted to talk about trade in Lebanon; I wanted to talk about ancient Egypt. When we think about displacement and war, oftentimes it becomes the single story as opposed to the full story of a place.\nEach recipe is paired with a personal story. Why was it important to put faces and names to these dishes?\nThat was the framework that I used in Bibi's Kitchen, bringing people in and saying: \"It's stories and recipes from grandmothers on the Indian Ocean.\" The same is true here: [when you] put a name on the recipe, put a face on it, it makes it real, brings it to life [and] makes it tangible. I think people are interested in other people. I think that's always been the framework for me. People first, food second. Stories [come] first.\nMore like this:\n•The flawless biscuit that took years to master\n•West Africa’s Michelin-starred cuisine wows London\n•The artichoke so prized that people sell fakes\nCan you share a favourite story from the book?\nThere isn't just one powerful story – everyone I spoke to shared something meaningful and full of impact. I hope the overall breadth of the book is what readers find powerful. It's the collective weight of these voices that tells the real story. The communities in this book show us what it looks like to carry home with you, even when you've been uprooted. That spirit is what's most important and inspiring.\nHow did the people you interviewed respond when you asked them to share their stories and recipes?\nTenderly. There was laughter, some tears and always, always a deep sense of pride.\nWhy do you think food holds identity so powerfully, especially in times of displacement?\nI got into food shortly after reuniting with my family, after 15 years of being apart. I started to question all that I had erased or tried to erase. I think in order for me to have got to the point where I am now, it was really important for me to understand where I came from. So I think sometimes food can provide a calling back of sorts to where we're from, or even sometimes give direction for where we're going.\nThe thing that I've come to understand is that [food is] sensory. A smell can place you in a whole different time in your life. A taste can place you at a whole different place. And I think that it's common: no matter who you are or where you are, you have to eat.\nWhen I was thinking about this book, [someone] said to me: \"I don't think people care about food when there's bombs going off over their heads.\" And I was like… \"Actually, food is the thing that grounds them.\"\nWhy was it important for you to tell stories of immigration and displacement, especially right now?\nSomebody needs to keep a record. Not just one person, but many people need to tell their stories as loud as possible so that the people in charge do not silence us into fear or into being othered.\nMore than ever, we need stories, we need storytellers, we need people who keep cultures intact. We need chefs; we need home cooks. I don't care if your way of being proactive in these times is just cooking a meal for a bunch of people who are trying to figure out the solution. I think more than ever, it's important to be at the table. And even if you don't know what the story is, listen to the other people who have a story to share.\nWhat do you hope readers will take away from Setting a Place for Us?\nI hope they come away with a deeper respect for the quiet, everyday ways people preserve culture. That they see how food is never just food – it's memory, identity and survival. This book isn't just a collection of recipes; it's a chorus of voices that have too often been left out of the story. My hope is that readers will cook these dishes, share them, and in doing so, make room at the table for all of us. "

    "title": "The New York region that changed history 250 years ago",
    "content": "A surprise dead-of-night attack helped lead to US independence from the British. Now, a series of events are commemorating the region's pivotal role in shaping the nascent nation.\nIn the violet-grey twilight before dawn in May 1775, a skeleton crew of soldiers were asleep insideFort Ticonderoga, a British-held garrison on the banks of Lake Champlain in New York's Adirondack region, when a series of shouts rang out. Rushing to their posts, the men were stunned by the sight of six dozen American soldiers streaming over the fort's walls, flintlock rifles in hand, demanding surrender.\nWith the British outnumbered and taken off guard, American victory was swift and bloodless. The fort's commander, sergeants, gunners and artillerymen were imprisoned and the invading forces captured 100 cannons and valuable weapons for the Continental Army. The surprise attack was a pivotal moment in the lead-up to theAmerican War of Independenceand marked the Continental forces' first offensive victory of the war that led to the United States' founding in 1776.\nThis year, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the conflict that shaped the nation, Fort Ticonderoga is hosting a series ofnew museum exhibitsalongside its regular lineup ofhistorical reenactments,guided toursandboat cruises– all of which provides travellers with a great jumping-off point to explore a region replete in Revolutionary War history.\nLake Champlain is a vast expanse that extends for roughly 435 square miles, straddling the borders of western Vermont and eastern New York and spilling into the Richelieu and St Lawrence rivers, which stretch north to Montreal and Quebec City in Canada. As Fort Ticonderoga curator Matthew Keagle told me, this made the waterway and its most prominent garrisons – Fort Ticonderoga andCrown Point, located 10 miles south – key locations for the movement of British troops, supplies and intelligence during the colonial period (roughly 1600 through 1776).\nEmboldened by the Massachusetts militiamen who defended the towns ofLexington and Concordagainst British forces and initiated the war a month earlier in April 1775, two of the US's more colourful Revolutionary War figures turned north-west towards Lake Champlain.Ethan Allen, leader of the scrappy Green Mountain Boys militia, andBenedict Arnold, an ambitious, impetuous merchant whose name would later become synonymous withtreachery, reluctantly agreed to share command of a dead-of-night attack on Ticonderoga.\n\"What was effectively a defensive war against the British… now turns into something very different,\" said Keagle, smartly dressed in a royal blue coat and knee-high boots, not unlike those depicted in the famous paintingCapture of Fort Ticonderoga, which the historian stood in front of. \"It dramatically changes the scope of the conflict.\"\nThe weapons captured at the fort were hauled 300 miles by oxen and ice sledge to Boston, where Patriots used them to batter, and ultimately expel, British troops in March 1776.\nToday, some of those cannons, mortars and Howitzers are among 200,000 objects displayed at Fort Ticonderoga's museum, which houses the western hemisphere's largest collection of 18th- and early 19th-Century munitions, and the US's largest assemblage of 18th-Century military uniforms. Weaponry and cultural artefacts can also be found at the newly expanded museum atCrown Point, which was also captured by the Americans in May 1775.\nThe experiences at the two sites diverge from there. Ticonderoga, or \"Fort Ti\" as locals call it, was restored to its original glory with squat, thick walls, pointed corners and a three-storey barracks building. Each year, staff launch new programming highlighting different periods of the bastion's history. This year's includes a new exhibit showcasing the US's nascent national identity, reenactments exploring everything from Arnold's surprising command to the science of defence and a demonstration showing how soldiers would have rowed fleet ships to and from Fort Ticonderoga.\nMore like this:\n•The quiet Massachusetts towns that sparked a revolution\n•The birthplace of the US vacation\n•The manmade waterway that transformed the US\n\"We constantly have to reevaluate how we understand the past,\" said Keagle, of the fort's frequently changing educational events. \"We want to bring visitors into the discussion, whether that's through our more specialised programmes like seminars and lectures, or by walking our trails and visiting our garden to see how people lived in this period of history.\"\nBy contrast, Crown Point is an elegiac ruin, the remnants of its 18th-Century military architecture reaching skyward from the fields. A series ofwell-marked trailsloop around the historical site and ring the shoreline, including one that connects to theNorth Country Scenic Trail,which crosses eight northern US states. Because the site lies along theAtlantic Flyway, depending on the time of year, you might hear the effervescent chatter of bobolinks (which arrive in late April) , see raptors winging overhead and waterfowl gliding across the lake. Since 1976, Crown Point's bird-banding station has recorded more than 126,000 birds across 110 species.\nThe Crown Point site is also a photographer favourite, both for its bird sightings and frozen-in-time features like a pair of abandoned limestone barracks and historical graffiti carved into the stones. \"We're preserving the ruins of structures and the archaeological record beneath the surface,\" explained site manager Sam Huntington.\nAround the region, a number of hikes offer panoramic views of boththe inimitable Adirondack landscapeand its Revolutionary landmarks.\nAtCoot Hill Trail, a hike known mainly to locals located about 10 miles away from Crown Point in the town of Moriah, New York, I met Arin Burdo, executive director ofChamplain Area Trails (CAT). Our boots crunched through a late crust of snow along the moderately challenging 1.1-mile path to the 1,100-ft summit of Bulwagga Mountain.\n\"The46 High Peaks[the highest peaks in the region] get all the attention in the Adirondacks,\" Burdo told me. \"Many of these lower-elevation hikes have big payoffs, and features like historic cemeteries or great birding, without the crowds.\"\nAs the trees parted around the summit, a blanket of farms and meadows spread out below. Peregrine falcons rode air currents arcing over the cliffs, set against the distant backdrop of the Green Mountains of Vermont. To the north, the ghostly barracks of Crown Point stood out along Lake Champlain's shore.\nThe region holds plenty of interest beyond its Revolutionary past. Fishing andboatingare popular in this part of the 400,000-acreChamplain-Adirondack Unesco Biosphere Reserve, but outdoor guide Elizabeth Lee encourages terrestrial exploration, especially on CAT's 100 miles of trails. Here you may find bobcats and white-tail deer, and fancifully named plants such as scaly shagbark hickory and Dutchman's breeches, their flowers like tiny white pantaloons suspended upside-down on a clothesline.\n\"The CAT trails definitely give a slice of life over time,\" Lee said, pointing to features that date from the colonial through the Revolutionary period and beyond. \"Some have remnants of quarries, mining, farming, forestry, which takes you through the early 1900s. And there's a lot of really fun architecture [that shows] the changes in American society in those towns.\"\nCase in point:Defiance Hall by War Cannon Spirits, a distillery opened in 2022. In its cavernous, circa-1820 sawmill building, five miles from the Crown Point Historic Site, a stone alcove behind the long wooden bar was lined with whiskey, rye and vodka. I sipped a Cannonball Old Fashioned, made with whiskey, bitters, maple syrup and ginger, and wondered who used the centuries-old forest behind me to slip between strategic locations.\nOn any given day in the hamlet ofElizabethtown, New York, originally settled by Revolutionary War veterans, you'll find a few dozen of the town's 1,000 residents, plus visitors like me, gathered at theDeer's Head Inn. Opened 1808 and used as a hospital during theWar of 1812, it's now a hotel and restaurant featuring local, sustainably produced foods that nod to the cuisine of the Revolutionary past: potted lamb served with toast and curry sauce, dry-cured meats, pickled vegetables and a pear and apple crumble atop a rustic pie crust.\nNight had fallen by the time I stopped in the town ofSchroon, New York, founded just after the Revolution on a 141-sq-mile lake of the same name. Moonlight glimmered on the glassy water, diffusing pinpricks of yellow light from the hilltop cabins of theLodge at Schroon Lake, which opened in 2023 on the grounds of a former religious compound. Like many places within the Adirondacks, the reminders of the US's founding here are both visible and elusive – preserved in ruins, reimagined in modern-day interpretations and reconstructions, and alive in our collective memory.

    "title": "From sea sparkles to fireflies: Chasing Australia's 'big four'",
    "content": "In Australia's Illawarra region, a ghostbusting-style night tour reveals ghost fungi, sea sparkles and tiny creatures lighting up the dark.\nOn a slate-black night, I stare at a horizon freckled with stars. Only this isn't the sky, illuminated by hundreds of constellations; it's the muddy bank of a river, charged by a colony of glow worms.\n\"This is my TV,\" says David Finlay. \"It's magical, like something out of Avatar.\" By day, Finlay works as a transport manager, but by night, he scours Australia's bushland and beaches chasing living light. \"If you're tucked up at home, you miss these things. Everybody cocoons themselves at night, whereas I think, what fun can I have?\" he says.\nBioluminescent creatures lurk in many corners of the world, but Australia's Illawarra region on New South Wales' south coast is a magnet for glowing phenomena. With low light pollution, ample rainfall and high humidity, it's an ideal microclimate for these creatures to thrive and trap prey.\nMany are clustered along theIllawarra Escarpment, a sweep of sandstone cliffs, fringed with forests that roll into the Pacific Ocean. \"Our escarpment habitat is special. It's a well-preserved subtropical rainforest environment, which helps protect fragile bioluminescent life forms,\" says Finlay.\nFrom his home in Kiama, Finlay can spot the \"big four\" within an hour's drive. There's sea sparkle, plankton that paints the ocean an electric blue; ghost fungi, mushrooms that radiate an eerie green; and glow worms and fireflies, which pierce the night-sky like tiny lanterns.\nThese natural phenomena are notoriously unpredictable and fickle to find, dictated by seasons, weather and light patterns. They are also extremely fragile, asmounting evidenceshows bioluminescent creatures are waning with climate-change and human disturbance.\nBut for a growing number of glow seekers, who, like Finlay, visit with care, the challenge is part of the adventure.\nWhen I meet Finlay at a clearing near Cascade Falls inMacquarie Pass National Park, it's only an hour past sunset, yet we're cloaked in darkness. It's Friday night, and while most people are under artificial lights, toasting to the end of the week, we're here to find natural shimmers in the night.\nWe trek through a path that cuts through the towering eucalypt trees, our head torches glowing red to cause minimal disturbance to wildlife. The full Moon pilots from above and the flow of the river whooshes us forward, guiding our footsteps towards the waterfall. \"If something flies straight past your face, it's probably just a micro bat,\" warns Finlay. \"They're very gentle, they're just looking for insects to eat.\"\nCascade Falls has an ideal microclimate for glow worms and fireflies, he explains. Glow worms aren't worms – in Australia and New Zealand, they are the larvae of fungus gnat. Elsewhere in the world, the glow often comes from beetles. They hide in wet, dark places, such as dank caves, abandoned tunnels or thick rainforest.\nGlow worms are endemic to Australia and New Zealand, and while many travellers visit iconic spots likeTamborine Mountainin Queensland, there are lesser-known colonies that can be discovered if you know where to look.\nAs my eyes adjust, I begin to notice more – the gnarled roots of a tree and a feathery mushroom cap. Finlay's vision is far better trained; he can easily spot silver spiders eyes blinking at us like cat's eyes on a motorway. He sweeps a UV torch across the floor, illuminating the undergrowth. A caterpillar glows fluorescent white, some lichen neon green, a leaf an aggressive shade of electric blue. \"Ah, that's just possum wee,\" he clarifies.\nFinlay runs ad hoc glow tours (when available, he posts them on hisFacebook page) in the Illawarra, showing locals and visitors the spectacle that most of us overlook at night. Last year, a few hundred places on his guided walks sold in a flash – as 25,000 people vied to secure a spot.\n\"For a lot of people, it's like finding gold, and nobody will tell you where they find the gold,\" says Finlay.\nBut it's a delicate balance between educating visitors and conserving these habitats. \"This national park is already impacted by people. I don't tell people about the really natural spots, as too many people would destroy those environments,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n•The Indian Ocean's laid-back 'paradise on Earth'\n•India's mysterious glowing forests\n•How a fictitious 'sea' became a top Maldivian tourist attraction\nBoth fireflies and glow worms are incredibly sensitive, susceptible to habitat destruction from people, urbanisation and bush fires. The \"Black Summer\" bushfires of 2019-20 wiped out a \"horrific\" number of bioluminescent creatures, he says, withcolonies impactedin national parks across Australia.\n\"I give people a list of dos and don'ts when they're out in the environment, and I tell them to teach other people this,\" says Finlay.\nA golden rule, like almost everything in the natural world, is to look but not touch. \"So much as holding a glow worm in the palm of your hand will kill them,\" says Finlay. Bright flashing lights or even breathing too close can trigger them to shut down and disrupt their feeding patterns. We keep our voices low and hushed, and we tread carefully, making sure to move through the bush slowly.\nFor safety, Finlay suggests bringing a friend on a night adventure. He beams a laser pointer through the sky, tracing the kite-like constellation of the Southern Cross, in case I ever get lost and need to navigate my way south.\nWe scramble down the embankment towards the mouth of the waterfall, following the tiny orbs of light. Tucked in the overhang of the river are dozens of glow worms, like a fairy grotto or twinkling Christmas light display. Up close, tendrils of silky web drip down, hanging like strings of pearls.\n\"Glow worms hide from sunlight, they'll crawl into nooks and crannies during the day, and when they come out at night, they have to rebuild their webs,\" says Finlay. Despite their beauty, these webs are death traps – snaring insects that are lured by glow-worm light.\nUnder the lens of the camera, the riverbank looks even more spectacular, with crystal droplets clustered around an iridescent light. It's clear whyBioluminescence Australia– a Facebook group with more than 64,000 members – has become so popular. The page was created to share photos of bioluminescent phytoplankton blooms, but it's also a message board for tracking down glowing phenomena.\nGlow hunters follow a rough calendar – glow worms can generally be found year-round, whereas fireflies glimmer for a short window in Australia's late spring/summer (November to February). Elusive ghost mushrooms tend to fruit in autumn (March to May) when the temperature cools.\nOne of the most sought-after experiences is paddling through bioluminescence, or bio. \"Everybody wants to see it, and one of the reasons is that it's so Instagrammable. You can swish your feet through it and make sparkles,\" says Finlay. One of the best spots to see a \"blue tide\" in Australia is in Jervis Bay, further along the NSW south coast, or around Hobart in Tasmania.\nChristine Dean Smith is a member of the group who has photographed sea sparkles for more than a decade. \"I hunt for bio because I have skin cancer and I'm banned from daylight,\" she says. \"Being a photographer, you tend to adjust yourself to finding nighttime nature to capture instead and then I show it to my followers.\"\nWhen we've spotted enough nature glowing, we retreat back through the bush to the clearing. Something flashes in my vision under Finlay's fluorescent torch – vivid, electric even; everything I've been told to keep my eyes peeled for. Maybe, I'm getting the hang of hunting for sparkles in the dark.\n\"Nope, just more possum wee,\" Finlay says. "

    "content": "From bubblegum-coloured lakes in Australia to a solar-powered safari camp in Botswana, these are BBC journalists' top destinations this year.\nTravel has the power to connect, inspire and even transform us. Peering over the edge of a crashing waterfall in Newfoundland and ascending sawtooth spires in the Italian Dolomites reveal how wondrous the world can be. But while travel should be a force for good, the past year has reminded us that it also has the potential to overwhelm and even harm the places we love, and many destinations are now imposing new restrictions as they grapple with the negative effects ofovertourism.\nIn the BBC's inaugural guide to the best places to travel this year, we wanted to highlight the destinations experiencing the opposite phenomenon. Each of these 25 spots is not only welcoming visitors and offering incredible travel experiences, but also using tourism to support local communities, protect the environment or preserve their unique cultural heritage. We compiled the list with input from BBC Travel journalists and some of the world's leading sustainable travel authorities, such as theUnited Nations World Travel Organization,Sustainable Travel International, theBlack Travel Allianceand theWorld Travel & Tourism Council.\nAs tourism in many regions soars pastpre-pandemic levels, and extreme weather and climate change reveal the fragile impermanence of many bucket-list destinations, travelling thoughtfully means considering where your trip can serve a larger good.\nFrom trekking through a moonlike landscape in Bolivia to Arctic glamping in Greenland on the world's largest island, your next great adventure is just ahead.\nEver wanted to swim alongside sperm whales? Dominica now offers the chance to do it in an ethical, sustainable way as part of the Caribbean island's groundbreaking commitment to marine conservation and regenerative tourism. The island nation recently established theworld's first sperm whale reserve, a protected marine area designed to safeguard its resident giants. Limited permits for whale swims ensure intimate, respectful encounters, offering visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience to share the water with these incredible cetaceans while facilitating research and creating sustainable tourism opportunities for local residents.\nNew for 2025, expanded infrastructure and systems are set to welcome visitors, including digital immigration forms to ease arrival and the development of a cable-car system taking riders fromRoseau Valleyup toBoiling Lake, one of the world's largest thermal springs. Access to the island has never been easier: on top of existing American Airlines flights from Miami, United Airlines islaunching direct flightsfrom Newark starting 15 February. Several new hotels are opening in 2025 (adding nearly 500 rooms with a 25% increase in inventory), including the six-star HiltonTranquility Beach Resort and Spain Salisbury. Or choose a tried-and-true classic such asSecret Bay,a luxury eco-property that frequently tops sustainability lists.\nDominica is also home toProject CETI, a groundbreaking international effort todecode whale language, clicks and codas, led by National Geographic Explorer David Gruber. Elsewhere, visitors can explore hidden gorges, towering waterfalls and feast on local cuisine at unique eateries, such as the farm-to-tableLacou. Dominica isn't just a destination – it's a movement to support a burgeoning model of eco-tourism that balances biodiversity conservation with economic growth, ensuring that your adventure helps protect this natural paradise for generations to come. –Pier Nirandara\nHome to one of Yayoi Kusama's iconic yellow, polka-dotted Pumpkin sculptures, the Japanese island ofNaoshimahas become a must-see destination for connoisseurs of contemporary art and architecture. Once known (if at all) for its highly polluting copper smelting industry, the island's transformation is thanks toBenesse Art Site Naoshima, which has helped create major museums and site-specific artworks in the scenically stunning (and dramaticallypopulation-dwindling) Seto Inland Sea, located between Japan's main island of Honshu and Shikoku.\nSpring 2025 sees the opening of theNaoshima New Museum of Art, designed by Tadao Ando, the award-winning architect behind nine other projects on the island. This new showcase for works by Asian artists will be a major highlight of this year'sSetouchi Triennale, with events and unveilings of artwork scattered across 17 islands and coastal areas of the Seto Inland Sea. Scheduled over 100 days and split between spring, summer and autumn to allow visitors to enjoy the region through the different seasons, this is the largest iteration of the Triennale since it began in 2010. The festival and activities of Benesse Art Site Naoshima have been instrumental in turning not only Naoshima's fortunes around but also reviving the neighbouring islands of Teshima and Inujima.\nBook ahead to visit Rei Naito and Ryue Nishizawa'sTeshima Art Museum, a one-of-a-kind synthesis of art, architecture and nature; while on Inujima, travellers will be amazed by the remains of a historic copper refinery reimagined as anepic-scale art installation. Memorable places to stay include Roka, a contemporary-styled ryokan on Naoshima, and the elegantly minimalistEspoir Innon Teshima. –Simon Richmond\nPerpetual fan favourite Italy hardly needs more press – especially in a year when its supremelyovertouristed capital, Rome, will be even more overwhelmed due to the 2025 Jubilee. But if Italy is still on your bucket list for 2025, consider taking a detour north to the Dolomite Mountains.\nFor Italians, the ruggedly beautiful Dolomites are synonymous with family fun and luxury holidays. The stunning sawtooth limestone cliffs sprawl across the regions of Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, attracting vacationing Italians in droves each year for their exquisite villages;peerless \"white week\" skiing; epic hike; and world-class, stick-to-your-ribs Alpine dishes. This classic Italian playground is often overlooked by overseas visitors – but that's all poised to change.\nThe \"Queen of the Dolomites\",Cortina d'Ampezzo, has been slated to co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The preparations, which will take place throughout 2025, include a vast series of infrastructure improvements throughout the area – all against a backdrop of pre-Olympic buzz. Visitors can expect to find expanded ski lift networks in the Dolomiti Superski area, where the towns ofAlta BadiaandVal Gardenawill launch modernised lifts and enhanced connections to public transit operating within the area. New and upgraded cable cars, lifts and gondolas will also be introduced throughout the regions' towns.\nBut the Dolomites is a thrilling destination in all seasons; visit in spring, summer and autumn to enjoy excellent trails, like 2024's newCammino Retico(The Rhaetian Way); a 170km, seven-day trail connecting remote villages between the Veneto and Trentino regions. And for pure relaxation, the luxuryAman Rosa Alpina hotelwill have its grand reopening in 2025. The property will now offer 51 guest rooms and suites, two presidential suites and the private Chalet Zeno. Visit now, before the crowds descend. –Eva Sandoval\nThere is nowhere on Earth likeGreenland. Spanning more than two million sq km, the world's largest island has a population of less than 57,000. Covered by a vast ice cap and spectacular mountains, itsunspoiled wildernessand majestic fjords aren't just acoveted geopolitical entity; they offer adventures of a lifetime.\nStunning hiking and spellbinding whale watching in summer and traditional dog sledding and the magical aurora in winter all make Greenland a bucket-list destination. However, it has been remote, expensive and time-consuming to reach – until now.\nWith the opening of a new international airport in the capital city of Nuuk and two more following in 2026, getting to Greenland has never been easier. The country is welcoming mindful adventure travellers who love exploring while also respecting its incredible nature and unique Inuit culture. Greenland hasadopted a pledge\"towards better tourism\" and a new law aims to steer funds from tourism towards benefitting local communities.\nA modern town with a historic waterfront, informative museums and impressive art galleries,Nuukis also a launchpad for hiking, fishing and glamping trips and acts as a gateway for exploring a remarkable Arctic territory. Further north inIlulissat, visitors can discover the jaw-dropping icebergs of Disko Bay and dramaticUnesco-recognised Icefjord. In the south, a region once settled by Vikings, there are gorgeous fjords and scenic green hills dotted with sheep farms. –Adrienne Murray Nielsen\nThough just one-sixth the size of England and far less visited than its more famous UK counterparts, Wales is filled with stunning national parks, awe-inspiring medieval castles and virtually no crowds – which only adds to its appeal. The new year offers travellers an additional excuse to explore one of Europe's most up-and-coming destinations: Wales is celebrating 2025 as theYear of Croeso(\"Welcome\"). The year-long event showcases Welsh culture, language and attractions while inviting visitors to \"Feel thehwyl\" – an untranslatable Welsh word describing a deep state of joy that comes from being immersed in the moment.\nIn recent years, Wales has positioned itself at the forefront of sustainable, culturally focused travel. Tourism has helped play a role in the revival of the Welsh language and the nation is in the midst of a multi-year £5 billion programme that uses tourism funds to make various destinations more environmentally sustainable. As part of its Year of Croeso, Wales isinvesting in mobility bikesto help more adventure-seekers explore its wild side. What's more, Wales is home to theWales Coast Path, the only hiking path in the world that runs the entire length of a country's coastline. –Eliot Stein\nLabrador, the mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada, is a vast, rugged region known for its windswept coastal villages, towering icebergs, subarctic forests and massive waterfalls – all underpinned by more than 9,000 years of human history. In 2025, the completion of the last stage of the 1,200kmTrans-Labrador Highway– a feat that took nearly 25 years and $1bn to build – transforms this remote 294,330 sq km landscape into a more accessible destination.\nThe new circular route (known as Expedition 51) connects Labrador with five Canadian provinces while offering detours into the US and even France (viaSt Pierre and Miquelon). To encourage sustainable tourism and celebrate the cultural heritage in this formerly isolated part of the north, the Canadian government has invested $180m into Parks Canada sites in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2025,Red Bay National Historic Site, a Unesco World Heritage Site and former Basque whaling station, will debut a new interactive boardwalk and visitor centre;L'Anse aux Meadows, home to the first Norse settlement in North America, is enhancing its ecological protections and upgrading visitor facilities; whileGros Morne National Parkwill introduce new interpretive exhibits that highlight the park's dramatic geology, wildlife and landscapes. –Diane Selkirk\nTucson has a lot to celebrate in 2025. This year marks the 10th anniversary of when it became the first city in the US to receive aUnesco City of Gastronomydistinction, as well as the 250th anniversary of the city's founding. Originally part of Mexico, the area now called Tucson will celebrate its unique multi-national history, as well as the deep-rooted Native American cultures that make it special, with a free event on 23 August featuring traditional Mexican music and dancing held at thePresidio San Agustin del Tucson. Visitors throughout the year can explore Tucson's miles ofdesert hiking trailsand historic buildings – like the 250-year-oldSan Xavier del Bac, the so-called \"White Dove of the Desert\". Preservation like this points to why the city is set to receive a Sustainability Index Award from theGlobal Destination Sustainability Movement(GDS) this year.\nBut while the building's history is impressive, the nearby gardens reveal an even richer history: they are the oldest continuously cultivated soil in the US. Four thousand years ago, the Tohono O'odham's ancestors farmed squashes, beans and corn on this land. After mixing and melding with Mexican and other Indigenous flavours over the centuries, many of these ancient herbs and crops are still staples in kitchens across the city. Diners can immerse themselves in the city's unique food scene at one of itscity-of-gastronomy-certified restaurantsorHeirloom Farmers Markets, which regularly feature unique local ingredients such as chiltepin chilis, edible cacti called nopales and prickly pear. –Lynn Brown\nKnown as the world's most isolated big city,Perth– and the state ofWestern Australia(WA) – have long played second fiddle to the east coast cities of Melbourne and Sydney. However, withAustralia's only direct flights to Europe, Perth is positioning itself as Australia's western gateway and a global aviation hub, with a $5bn redevelopment of Perth Airport set to enhance the travel experience. And withnew connections to Asia, WA is poised to become a must-visit destination in 2025.\nBut it's not just about getting here – it's about what awaits. Outside of newly cool Perth and its gorgeousSwan Valley Wine Region, WA's vast landscapes span more than 2.5 million sq km, encompassing 12,500km of pristine coastline, bubblegum-pink lakes, horizontal waterfalls, towering karri forests, wildflowers, wineries and wildlife encounters like swimming with whale sharks and snapping selfies with quokkas, the \"happiest animal in the world\". Sustainability-minded road trippers can explore it all on the new6,600km Electric Vehicle Highway, the world's longest EV charging network.\nWA is also championing its rich cultural heritage through the A$20mJina Aboriginal Tourism Action Planthat supports authentic Indigenous-led experiences for travellers as well as Indigenous business development. Learn about the oldest living cultures on Earth on atruth-telling walking tourin Rockingham or a4WD tag-along coast foraging tourcomplete with bush barbecue in Broome.\nAdd ancient petroglyphs atMurujuga National Park(under consideration for Unesco World Heritage status in 2025), new disability-friendly infrastructure and equipment on the stunningHoutman Abrolhos Islands,boutique hotelsin Fremantle andtiny dream staysin the Great Southern, and WA is set to redefine travel to Australia this year. –Ellie Cobb\nFrom its misty hilltop tea plantations and roaming wild elephants to its ancient temples and rolling surf, Sri Lanka is a country that ticks lots of boxes. In April 2022, the former prime minister announced Sri Lanka's bankruptcy, but anew presidentaims to rebuild the country's fortunes after it was hit by a pandemic and civil unrest.\nThe resilient island nation is hoping to get back on its feet through tourism. The city ofKandywill see the opening of its first seven-star hotel,Aviyana Private Chalets, whileAarunya Nature Resorthas a new family villa that includes an oculus for stargazing. There's a$1bn megaresortopening in Colombo, and the launch of Sri Lanka's new airlineAir Ceilão, which will fly as far as Europe and Australia. The nation also recently launched theGood Travel Seal initiative, which celebrates local businesses who have adopted sustainable practices.\nVisitors looking for a coolcation can take alegendary train rideinto its mountainous interior, or travel to Colombo and Galle to discover a new generation of mixologists putting their spin on arrack, a 5th-Century drink. The island has also opened the 300kmPekoe Trail, which takes hikers through tea plantations and rural villages in the Central Highlands. For those who want to cover more ground, an innovative startup allows travellers toself-drive a tuk tukacross the island, with the money going directly to the owner. –Claire Turrell\nAfter managing the Panama Canal for decades, the US handed control of it over to Panama at the end of 1999 in a treaty signed by the late US President Jimmy Carter. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Panama's sovereignty over its namesake waterway, and as President-elect Donald Trumphints at the possibilityof using military force to reseize it, a series of new permanent exhibits at the landmark'sMuseo del Canalhighlighting its path to Panamanian rule feels especially timely.\nYet, there's more to see in this nation of vast jungles, idyllic islands and mountainous forests beyond the canal. In 2024, theMeaningful Travel Map to Panamalaunched in partnership with non-profit Tourism Cares to make it easier for visitors to find locally led travel experiences across the country. After embarking on aLocalinptywalking tour through Panama City's Casco Antiguo and El Chorrillo neighbourhoods, head south-west to the La Pintada district, where artists weave fibers to make traditional Panama hats by hand – a Unesco-recognised practice known assombrero pintao. InEl Valle de Anton(named one of the best community tourism villages byUN Tourism in 2024) take a hike through a lush cloud forest on theCerro Gaital Lookout Trailwhere you can see both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea on a clear day from the summit. This newly opened path is part of Panama's ongoing1,000 km of Trailsproject, which seeks to boost sustainable tourism in rural communities while bringing hikers face to face withPanama's staggering biodiversity. –Kathleen Rellihan\nSnowcapped mountains, sweeping deserts, ancient cities andrich cultural heritagehave long made Morocco one of North Africa's most popular destinations. But theAl Haouz earthquake of September 2023not only devastated parts of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains, it also severely impacted tourism. As Morocco continues to build (and rebuild) its tourism infrastructure in preparation forco-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the nation is aiming todouble its tourist arrivalsin the next five years.\nBypass the crowds by taking a road trip through the Rif Mountains in Morocco's less-frequented northern region.The planned 2025-2027 expansionof Morocco's High-Speed Rail (HSR) network will create a multitude of new train lines, including a link from Rabat to the ancient, 1,300-year-old walled Rif Mountain city ofFez; home to aUnesco World Heritage medinaand the host of several games in theAfrica Cup of Nations 2025. From Fez, it's a 65km drive north to Moulay Idriss, an ancient hilltop village once closed to non-Muslims. Pass through olive and almond groves and mountain villages for a stop inOuezzane– a centre of Sufism – then continue north toTalassemtane National Parkto hike through cedar forests, climb craggy red peaks and dive into natural swimming holes. Further north is the town ofChefchaouen, known as the \"Blue Pearl\" for its blue-painted buildings and streets. Finally, cruise along Morocco's northern coast, unwinding in sleepy Mediterranean fishing villages likeEl Jebhaand the white-washed Spanish colonial buildings ofTetouan. –Alicia Erickson\nThe northern English city ofBradfordis finally poised to step out from the long shadow cast by its giant Yorkshire neighbour, Leeds, as it takes its place as the2025 UK City of Culture. A fabulousyear-long programme of eventsincludes the re-opening of theNational Science and Media Museum, plus innovative celebrations of local cultural icons: more than 400 works by Bradford-born artist David Hockneyheld in a Unesco World Heritage 1850s mill; newdigital takeson a fantasy world dreamed up by the famed literary Brontë sisters; and a musical programme mixing anelectronic bassline symphony,old factory folk music,brass bandsandSouth Asian sounds.\nThe diversity of offerings reflects the eye-opening variety of a city whose historic enclaves like Little Germany – where 19th-Century Teutonic wool merchants built an array of neoclassical warehouses – are complemented by a landscape of dramatic moors that play host to an extraordinaryopen-air immersive sound walkmixing contemporary classical music with asculpture trail. A special energy also comes from the local residents who represent diverse backgrounds (and youth – a quarter are under 20 years old).\nBradford's historic streets and rugged country setting helped the city become Britain's firstUnesco City of Film(an accolade shared with places as varied as Rome, Sydney and Busan) – a setting for screen hits including BBC series like Peaky Blinders and Gentleman Jack, and classic films like The Railway Children andWuthering Heights.\nAnd this year, there's even aninteractive cookbook project, celebrating recipes from local communities and showing that in 2025, Bradford is truly a destination to please all tastes. –Norman Miller\nHome to some of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes and the ancient capital of one of history'smost mysterious civilisations, Jordan never fails to evoke wonder. But take a closer look and you'll find that the country has been quietly building up its reputation as the Middle East's go-to destination for outdoor adventure-seekers.\nIn 2023, a stunning new 10-day, 120km-long hiking path known as theWadi Rum Trailopened, which weaves through the rust-red walls of Jordan's iconic Wadi Rum, tracing the otherworldly landscapes featured in the films Star Wars, Dune and The Martian. Visitors have traditionally breezed through the desert here on 4x4 tours, but this community tourism project promotesa slower, more sustainable form of travelthat protects the desert's delicate ecosystem while safeguarding the rich cultural heritage of the local Bedouin community.\nElsewhere, this Maine-sized nation is teeming with 33 protected land and marine ecosystems. At theWadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve(the world's lowest-lying nature reserve at 410m below sea level), visitors can search for the illusive desert-dwelling Nubian ibex while climbing, swimming and sliding their way through a sandstone gorge to the base of a crashing waterfall.The Dana Biosphere Reserve(Jordan's largest), is home to 180 bird species and 25 endangered mammal species. The rich coral reefs of theAqaba Marine Reserve, which was added to theIUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areasin January 2025, support more than 500 fish species and a growingdivingscene. –Florence Craig\nAlmost completely isolated from the outside world for centuries, this erstwhile hermit kingdom nestled in the Himalayas only began welcoming foreigners in 1974. It's since become a global leader in sustainability: it's theworld's first carbon-negative nation, more than 60% of its land is protected forest and it measuresGross National Happinessinstead of GDP.\nThe Haa Valley, a pristine forested district along Bhutan's western frontier with Tibet, has long been the country's best-kept secret: a culturally distinct region still untouched by mass tourism. This forgotten corner of the Thunder Dragon Kingdom was the last district to open to foreigners in 2002, and today, fewer than 2% of international travellers visit, despite it being a yak's graze from Paro International Airport. It's now emerging from the shadows, balancing preservation with thoughtful development in its bid for more visitors.\nTravellers can explore Haa's raw beauty through the newly restored 400kmTrans Bhutan Trail; the freshly-added 11kmHaa Panorama Trail(a revival of an ancient route); and the two-dayJoy Bay Tsho Trek, which snakes through pastures, canopy forests and bamboo groves between the villages of Mochu and Youkha.\nHaa's commitment to sustainable tourism means you'll find locally run homestays (and some local hotels) offering glimpses into centuries-old rural life. Two distinct, low-impact accommodations have also opened: the community-runKatsho Eco Camp, built along the Haa Panorama Trail by guides and cooks who lost their jobs during the pandemic, and the luxurySangwa Camp.Here, visitors witness local culture, likeBon ritualsand rare experiences such as breakfast in Bhutan'slone strict nature reserve, a highly protected biodiversity hotspot home to rare species like the red panda and snow leopard.\nWith Bhutan'sSustainable Daily Feehalved through 2027 (now $100), this once-secluded paradise is now more accessible while remaining just as committed to low-impact tourism. –Erin Levi\nMore than a year after a series of deadly wildfiresdevastated Maui, the entire state is experiencing a dramaticdownturnin visitors. As families and local businesses continue to rebuild, they're asking travellers to return, but todo so responsibly.\nEnter theMālama Hawaiiprogramme. Meaning \"to protect\" or \"give back\",mālamais a Hawaiian word embodying a sense of stewardship and respect for the environment. As such, the programme pairs travellers with more than 350 volunteer opportunities, ranging fromrestoring native foreststosewing and cookingwith Maui families tohelping to preserve plant and animal habitatson the slopes of Mount Kea. In exchange, travellers receive discounted – or in some cases, free – stays atdozens of hotels and resorts across the islands, including the famousFour Seasons Resort Maui at Waileawhere the first season of The White Lotus was filmed. –Eliot Stein\nUzbekistan has one of the youngest populations in the world – more than 60% are under 30. Being surrounded by a sea of young people on Tashkent's metros, which double as art museums with Soviet-era mosaics, you can see a new generation taking over. As the country strives to maintain its unique traditions and cultures, it is investing in tourism with new hotels, train routes, domestic flights and cultural attractions to grow its economy, retain its youth and attract more visitors.\nUzbekistan is getting its first major international biennial with theBukhara Biennialin September 2025. Other major cultural developments include anexpansion of the State Museum of Artsdesigned by Tadao Ando and the restoration and partial reconstruction of thePalace of Prince Romanov.\nAs of May 2024,citizens of more than 90 countries(including the UK, Canada and Australia) can visit Uzbekistan without a visa. The president has said he intends to create aGlobal Green Tourism Startup Labto bring together the country's commitment to a green economy with tourism. Crossing the border with neighbouring countries has also become easier. The region's first international railway route, theSilk Road railway tour, launched in November 2024 and now connects Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. –Kathleen Rellihan\nHaida Gwaii, an archipelago of more than 150 islands off the coast of British Columbia, offers more than breathtaking landscapes – it provides a profound connection to nature, culture and history. Isolated from the mainland, the ecologically rich islands are home to more than 6,800 species, including endemic birds, mammals and plants that have sustained the Haida People for at least 15,000 years.\nWhat makes Haida Gwaii a standout destination in 2025 is the groundbreakingGaayhllxid/Gíihlagalgang \"Rising Tide\" Haida Title Lands Agreement. This legislation marks a transformative moment in Indigenous rights in Canada, officially recognising the Council of the Haida Nation as the territory's governing body under federal law. This shift is working to revitalise Haida culture and strengthen their environmental stewardship.\nVisitors can explore long-abandoned Haida villages likeSG̱ang Gwaay, a Unesco World Heritage Site with ancient mortuary poles and longhouse remains; and encounter distinctive wildlife such as theHaida Gwaii black bear(calledtaanin the local dialect) and seabirds like puffins and ancient murrelets. Upon arrival, guests are introduced to Haida Laws, including the concept ofGina 'waadluxan gud ad kwaagid(\"everything depends on everything else\"), a teaching that underscores our shared responsibility to care for the Earth. –Diane Selkirk\nHome to mist-shrouded rainforests, emerald lakes, towering volcanoes and one of the Americas' oldest and most attractive cities (Unesco-enshrinedGranada, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in December 2024), Central America's largest country remains one of its least visited. That may soon change with the opening of the new Carretera Costanera: a $400m, 350km-long highway linking 53 beaches along the nation's Pacific Coast, from the Gulf of Fonseca in the north to the turquoise waters of Playa El Naranjo in the south.\n\nSet to be completed in 2025, the ambitious new infrastructure project makes it much easier to shoot south from Nicaragua's sprawling capital, Managua, to the tropical forests and the world-class surf hubs of San Juan del Sur and Popoyo along the country's 50km-long Emerald Coast – which has been luring in-the-know backpackers for years. More importantly, the Costanera is aiming to breathe new economic life into the nation, which isone of the poorestin the Western hemisphere and views itsgrowing tourism sectoras key to its economic growth.\nAfter learning to ride a wave at a locally ownedsurf campand sleeping in atreehousetucked inside a rainforest, venture to theRefugio de Vida Silvestre La Florat the highway's southern tip, where thousands of endangered olive ridley and leatherback turtles lay their eggs between September and October in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. –Eliot Stein\nDespite being ringed on all sides by the UK – Northern Ireland to the west, Scotland to the north, England to the east and Wales to the south – this cliff-fringed island isn't actually part of the Commonwealth. Instead, the self-governing isle is said to be ruled by the world's oldest continuous parliament, the Tynwald, and it's committed to preserving its distinct character and developing a sustainable tourism model.\nAwash with ancient historical sites, such asCashtal yn Ard(\"Castle of the Height\", the largest Neolithic tomb in the British Isles) andCastle Rushen(one of the most complete medieval structures in Europe), the 85,000-resident island is decidedly forward-thinking. In 2016 it was recognised as aUnesco Biosphere(the world's only self-governing territory whose entire land and sea area has such designation) for its commitment to environmental preservation and cultural heritage. This year, witness the isle's spectacular native bird species at the newManx Birdlife Point of Ayre National Reserve, which opened to the public in July 2024. Also on tap for 2025 is the 175th anniversary ofOkell's Brewery, so celebrate this iconic Manx brew by partaking in tasting tours that will be held throughout the year.\nIn addition to learning a few words in Manx Gaelic (the island's historical language) and familiarising yourself with the Manx pound (the island's unique currency), one of the best ways to understand this unique British Crown Dependency is toexplore it on foot. Taking advantage of the isle'smyriadof organisedwalking events, hikers will find rolling English fields, misty Irish hills and craggy Welsh coastlines – as well as dramatic Scottish Highland-esque peaks on the Isle's highest point, Snaefell mountain. On a clear day, trekkers can turn in a circle on its wind-whipped summit to see each country in the UK and Ireland. –Lynn Brown\nPakistan is one of the world's most populated nations, yet it remains one of the great surprises for travellers. That may soon change, as the country is hoping a slew ofresponsible tourism initiativesandnew sustainable effortswill lure eco-conscious visitors to explore its breathtaking northern regions; home to five of the planet's 14 peaks towering over 8,000m – including the world's second highest, K2.\nSalam Pakistan(Pakistan's first-ever national tourism brand, which launched in 2023) allows travellers to easily apply for e-visas and make bookings on the digital platform, including the coveted mountaineering and trekking visa. It only takes a quick glance at the list ofmountain peaksandtreksto see the scale of Pakistan's unmatched adrenaline opportunities.\nYet, Pakistan is much more than staggering mountain trails. The scenic Gilgit-Baltistan region – dubbed \"heaven's gate\" – is brimming with lush valleys, pristine lakes and glacial waterfalls. Cradled between trails are the Hunza Valley's fragrant cherry blossoms and apricot orchards, undulating Unesco-listedDeosai plainsand Shangri-La-esque mirrored lakes. Venture towards the Pakistan-China border to find the Khunjerab Pass, which will be operationalyear-roundstarting in 2025. –Aysha Imtiaz\nMarooned in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean some 1,500km west of Lisbon, this nine-island Portuguese archipelago is one of Europe's most isolated destinations and is known for its steaming natural hot springs, jewel-coloured lakes and sparkling lava tubes. The Azores already boast some of the continent's most dramatic black-sand beaches and bestwhale-watchingopportunities, but the islands can now add another superlative to the list:Europe's largest protected marine sanctuary.\nIn a groundbreaking piece of legislation approved in October 2024, the Azores' newly designated Marine Protected Area will extend 287,000 sq km (an expanse larger than all of Great Britain) and safeguard deep-sea corals, sharks and the 28 species of whales and dolphins found here. Protecting the long-term health and biodiversity of these coral reefs will be a boon for travellers eager to participate in whale-watching and sustainable marine research expeditions in the years to come.\nElsewhere, a scenic drive from the capital of Ponta Delgada,Furnas Valleyis home to two active volcanoes. Spend some time hot spring hopping your way across the bubbling geothermal valley, wander through lush botanical gardens or enjoy a leisurely stroll inTerra Nostra Park, arguably one of Europe's most beautiful parks. Dating back to 1775, the eponymousTerra Nostra Garden Hotelis a bonafide green retreat that will offer guests 24-hour access to their newly enhanced thermal pools and jacuzzis starting in January 2025. Don't leave without sampling thecozido das Furnas– a local meat stew buried underground and slow-cooked using the volcanic hot springs' natural heat. Nearby, sample purple volcanic tea atChalet da Tia Mercês, or plan a visit to the family-ownedGorreana Tea Factory, the oldest (and only) tea plantation in Europe. –Michelle Gross\nKansas City, Missouriis making 2025 its glow-up year.

Bolivia's prettiest city, Chuquisaca (also called Sucre), where the declaration of independence was signed in 1825, is home to many Quechua peoples. While there, be suer to visit theMuseo de Arte Indígenafor an up-close look at the country's ancient textile tradition.

But as the countryushers in a new governmentand continues to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, its tourism sector (and sustainable cache) only stands to grow in 2025, with an increased demand for sustainable and culturally immersive travel experiences. In a bid to bolster tourism and strengthen the economy, Botswana has granted visa-free entry to visitors from 104 countries in recent years – including those from the US, UK, Germany and Canada. This means more travellers can now explore Botswana's natural beauty, including the \"Elephant Capital of the World\",Chobe National Park, and the Unesco-listedOkavango Delta; a vast wetland in the Kalahari Desert that is one of the world's last havens for cheetahs and the black rhinoceros.\nThe Okavango Delta will also see a number of new openings, including the 100% solar-poweredMbamba Campin the delta's lagoon-and-savannah-dotted north, a luxury lodge offering a blend of comfort and family-friendly wildlife adventures that's slated to open in April 2025. Opening in May 2025 isMonachira Camp,where visitors can enjoy walking safaris, mokoro canoe rides andarmchair safariswhile coming face to face with elephants, lions and the Pel's Fishing Owl.\nStarting in April 2025, new Air Botswana routes will connect Gaborone to Cape Town, making it even easier for visitors to explore Botswana's magical nature for themselves – sustainably. –Eva Sandoval\n\"Is it even a city?\" arecent viral adfor Oslo, Norway asked.

    "title": "Monaco's new €2bn neighbourhood rising out of the sea",
    "content": "Built on reclaimed land, Monaco's new Mareterra district blends cutting-edge sustainability with scenic sea views, offering a fresh way to explore the principality.\nIt was just past noon inMareterra, Monaco's newest neighbourhood, and a crowd swelled on the terrace outsideMarlow,the principality's first British fine-dining restaurant. Nearby, office workers stretched out on wide steps by the water for their lunch break. Promenade Prince Jacques, the 800m pedestrian walkway that sweeps around the sea-facing perimeter of Mareterra, was busy with parents pushing strollers and joggers pounding the concrete pavement. I paused to soak up the view across the expanse of blue sea towards the leafy Roquebrune-Cap-Martin headland and Italy beyond. The area blended so seamlessly with the surrounding landscape that I struggled to remember how, six months ago, this was still an unfinished construction site – and that eight years ago, where I stood was the Mediterranean Sea.\nThis reclaimed district, a €2bn project unveiled in December 2024, is Monaco's latest answer to a question it has faced for more than 150 years: how do you expand when you've already run out of land?\nI walked along the promenade and ducked through a door along the path, entering a dark, concrete antechamber. Another door led through to the hollowed interior of one of 18 caissons, the 10,000 ton, 26m-high chambers that sit side by side like giant Lego bricks on the seafloor to create the maritime infrastructure of the new neighbourhood.\nIn the dark, unlit space, it took a while for my eyes to catch up to what my ears immediately recognised: waves, crashing against a wall then flopping back onto the water's surface. I peered over a thick railing separating me from the drop into the sea below. The Mediterranean surged up as if reaching for my attention, while the reinforced concrete chamber remained silent and immobile as it soaked up the impact of the swell.\nThe top of the upper section of each caisson, which is known as the Jarlan chamber, is above the waterline to allow water to flow in and out through thin, vertical openings on the outward-facing side. The design has been engineered to act as a breakwater to absorb and disperse the energy of the waves.\n\"That means, even during 100-year storms, they won't rise too high nor submerge [Mareterra],\" said Guy Thomas Levy-Soussan, the managing director of SAM L'Anse du Portier, the developers of Mareterra, as we stood in La Grotte Bleue, as this space is called, named after the Blue Grotto of Capri. \"When the Sun shines through the openings in the Jarlan chamber in the morning, there's a slightly blue hue to the space,\" he said, explaining the choice of name.\nLa Grotte Bleue doesn't sparkle under the weight of four walls adorned in pastel pink and lavender purple quartz likeits Instagram-pretty neighboura couple of doors down, a meditation room for quiet contemplationdesigned by Vietnamese artist Tia-Thủy Nguyễn. And I probably would feel a little uneasy being in the dark space alone. Yet it has quickly become one of the Mediterranean principality's most unusual, and least glossy, landmarks, attracting a steady flow of people like me, curious for a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the technical ingenuity involved in reclaiming land from the sea.\nLand reclamation is nothing new in Monaco, the world's second-smallest country after the Vatican City, where 38,000 residents cram into a territory just more than 22sq km in size. While a high proportion of that figure are millionaires, they're still living in the mostdensely populated country in the world.\nHemmed in by France, Monaco's default solution to its space issue is to extend out into the water. Since 1907, 25% of Monaco's territory has been reclaimed, including the principality's beachfront,Larvotto, the superyacht-lined Port Hercules and theFontvieilledistrict to the west of the Prince's Palace of Monaco.\nIf Prince Rainier III, who came to power in 1949, carved out a reputation as \"the builder prince\", his son and current sovereign, Prince Albert II, is continuing the tradition. It was in 2013 when he announced plans to reclaim these six hectares just off the coast near Larvotto at Monaco's eastern extent, later naming it Mareterra to reflect its connection to the sea and the land. The neighbourhood has increased the principality's territory by 3% and comprises two residential apartment blocks (including one designed by celebrated Italian architectRenzo Piano), 10 villas and four townhouses, a small marina, 14 commercial spaces and three hectares of public space.\nMareterra fits like the missing piece of a puzzle into this stretch of Monaco's coastline. It is latched alongside theGrimaldi Forum, an event space that often hosts travelling art exhibitions and stage shows, and theJapanese Garden, planted in 1994 with Mediterranean pines, pomegranate and olive trees in accordance with Zen design principles. Both sites have been able to grow in size thanks to the extension.\nIn line with the Prince's commitment to make the principality carbon neutral by 2050, Mareterra has also been imagined as Monaco's greenest corner. Nine thousand square metres of solar panels, 200 EV charging stations and 800 trees are among the eco-friendly initiatives in the district.\nJust inside the entrance to La Grotte Bleue, a five-minute longvideoplays on a loop, an introduction to how the project addressed the inevitable marine disruption that comes with such construction. The caissons hold a key role here, as well; reliefs and grooves were moulded into their construction to encourage marine flora and fauna colonisation. Segments were even sanded by hand to add texture. The Jarlan chambers have an additional bonus, recreating shallow areas where fish can dart in and out.\nThe most delicate of challenges, however, involved transplanting 384sq m ofPosidonia oceanica, an endemic seagrass that playsa critical rolein the Mediterranean ecosystem and is protected by EU legislation. Apioneering techniqueused a modified tree spade to scoop Posidonia sods into baskets which could then be replanted 200m away in theLarvotto Marine Protected Area. \"Usually we transport Posidonia plants one by one,\" explained Sylvie Gobert, an oceanologist at the University of Liège in Belgium who worked on the project. \"What is ultimately innovative is that we took the Posidonia, along with its entire root ecosystem and about a cubic metre of sediment.\"\nMore like this:\n•Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n•8 ways to travel more sustainably in 2025\n•Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\nIf the Posidonia has ultimately settled into its new home, so has Monaco into Mareterra. As I surveyed the area, I realised how quickly the soft blues and greys of Le Renzo, Piano's striking residential block that stands sentinel over the neighbourhood, has become a familiar part of the local landscape. Nearby,Quatre Lances, a sculpture by American artist Alexander Calder that was purchased by Prince Albert's mother, Grace Kelly, in the 1960s and had been languishing in storage, has become a meeting point where people gravitate. A small nature walk, La Pinède, winds through a rocky garden planted with Aleppo and umbrella pines, the same species you would find if you were hiking through the Provence countryside. A water source gently trickled past birds' nests and insect hotels installed amid the Mediterranean shrub. These aren't the glossy attractions that Monaco is renowned for, like the gildedCasino de Monte-Carlo. It's an area that has been designed for locals, with only a handful of shops and restaurants, although visitors come to enjoy the peaceful gardens, sea views and the ingenuity of how Mareterra came to be.\nDespite its ecological ambitions, Mareterra raises questions about necessity. Though billed as Monaco's answer to its housing challenges, property prices are speculated to start from €100,000 per square metre, making it some of the most expensive real estate in the world. Plus, none of the new residences have been reserved for Monegasques, who number nearly 10,000 and have a right to subsidised housing.\nHowever, those in Monaco are sure that Mareterra isn't the end of its growth story. \"For Prince Albert, if there isn't construction, the country is at a standstill,\" said Nancy Heslin, co-founder ofCarob Tree Publishing, Monaco's first all-female publishing house, who has interviewed the Prince on various occasions. \"The country will always seek to continue to expand its territory.\"\n\"As long as it [has] the desire – and budget – to push the boundaries of what is possible on both a technological and ecological scale, the principality will be an example for other coastal cities to follow. As a laboratory for this kind of innovation,\" said Levy-Soussan, \"Monaco is a small country that has done extraordinary things.\" "

    "content": "The cheesy, peppery pasta dish has become as viral as chef Nadia Munno's cooking videos. Here are her favourite places to get it in her hometown of Rome.\nFor Roman chef and businesswoman Nadia Caterina Munno – better known to her five million-strong legion of social media followers as \"The Pasta Queen\" – the rich pasta dish ofcacio e pepe, represents everything she loves about her hometown.\n\"Romans are loud, aggressive, but really friendly. Their friendliness is a form of love,\" she says. \"Roman cuisine is [also] very punchy and aggressive – up [in northern Italy], dishes are more delicate – and cacio e pepe is very traditionally Roman.\"\nIndeed, made by simply tossing pasta, Pecorino cheese, hot pasta water and toasted black peppercorns together, cacio e pepe (literally: \"'cheese and pepper\") is Roman cuisine par excellence: humble, salty and spontaneous.\nIn recent years, the dish has become afirm favourite overseas, with restaurants from New York to London proudly serving their versions of the savoury recipe. It has also become one of the main stars of Munno's larger-than-life home cooking videos, which are peppered with aSophia Loren-esque theatricalityand replete with gushing references to the \"pasta gods\".\nMunno's own royal moniker may pose a rather grand claim, but she's hardly a usurper: she heralds from a family that has been producing pasta for centuries, even garnering the nickname of the \"Macaronis\".\n\"To be a 'pasta queen' you have to have an experience and a background: these are the dishes I cooked all my life,\" she explains. \"I want to teach people about the values of Italian food, which bring people together, to enjoy life a bit more.\"\nShe adds: \"Food shouldn't be treated as an afterthought. Empires were forged on food.\"\nAnd though Rome's history may be imperial, cacio e pepe – much like other classic Roman pasta dishes likecarbonaraandamatriciana– is a humble dish, deeply rooted in the city's working class culture, with influences from the nearby shepherds who moved to Rome from the Apennine mountains. What may come to a surprise to some is that cacio e pepe is not even one of the most consumed dishes in the Roman kitchen. Its recent popularity, Munno says, is largely a product of social media marketing.\n\"It's not as sought after from Romans as from tourists who come to visit the city,\" Munno notes. \"It's definitely traditional, but cacio e pepereally has gone viral, being popularised internationally.\"\nAll this notwithstanding, the dish is now a consolidated part of Rome's culinary repertoire, a staple in trattorie and family homes across the city.\nHere are Munno's favourite places to get cacio e pepe in Rome.\nIf there's any restaurant in Rome which can legitimately lay claim to being the \"king\" of cacio e pepe, it'sFelice a Testaccio– and Munno recommends going there to experience the dish like a true local.\n\"I liked going to [Felice a Testaccio] because I grew up nearby,\" Munno says. \"It's a place which is popular with the local people, and the food is amazing.\"\nFor Felice a Testaccio, cacio e pepe is a veritable artform – and one whose creation is displayed to clients, as themantecatura(emulsification) of the pasta in the Pecorino cheese is performed tableside.\nUsing freshtonnarelli(thick spaghetti), Felice a Testaccio's cacio e pepeis decadent, sharp and creamy, the Roman dish in its most sumptuous form.\nAs its name suggests, Felice is located in the city's scruffy, vibrant Testaccio neighbourhood, which was built onthe remains of an ancient Roman trash heapand the port that serviced the city with its food. Today, the neighbourhood maintains its culinary tradition as the location of the monumental Testaccio food market.\n\"It's one of the main markets of Rome,\" Munno says.\nThe district, located south of the city centre, doesn't quite reek of \"dolce vita\" in the postcard-perfect, Hollywood sense – think less Roman Holiday and more graffitied walls and post-war apartment blocks – but it's as quintessentially Roman as it gets, and Munno recommends sinking your teeth into – and its food.\n\"The area doesn't get enough love,\" Munno says. \"But it'sveryRoman.\"\nWebsite:https://feliceatestaccio.com\nAddress: Via Mastro Giorgio, 29, 00153\nPhone: + 39 06 574 6800\nInstagram: @feliceatestaccio\nWhen it comes to finding a more refined, gourmet-approved take on Roman cuisine, thenRoscioli Salumeria con Cucinais your port of call.\nThe restaurant – opened near the Campo de' Fiori street market in 1972 and now part of a local chain of bakeries and eateries – offers sophisticated, yet still authentic, takes on classic Roman and other Italian dishes, within an elegant setting that attracts an exclusive clientele. Its ingredients are sourced from the best suppliers, and its cacio e pepe is no exception.\n\"Roscioli is truly authentic Roman [food],\" Munno says. \"What they serve is truly amazing.\"\nUsing freshtagliolinipasta, Nepalese black pepper and a touch of extra virgin olive oil to help bind the sauce, Roscioli's cacio e pepe is delicate and refined, yet still full of the tangy saltiness of the traditional Roman recipe.\n\"It's incredibly gorgeous,\" Munno says.\nReserve in advance, as bookings can be competitive.\nWebsite:https://www.roscioli.com\nAddress: Via dei Giubbonari, 21, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 687 5287\nInstagram:@rosciolisalumeria\nHostaria da Cesare, which celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2021, brims with nostalgia, with a distinct \"frozen-in-time-feel\": a time capsule of what may seem like a bygone era.\nWarm, wood-panelled interiors give it a distinctly cosy, mid-century charm. Da Cesare's cacio e pepe – one of the city's best, according to Munno – is traditional and rich, made with spaghetti, coated in a flurry of shaved Pecorino and black pepper.\nConveniently placed in the central Prati quarter, an elegant, 19th-Century Parisian-esque grid of streets close to the Vatican, Hostaria Da Cesare is centrally located but also somewhat shielded from the tourist throngs.\n\"It isn't particularly touristy, but it's getting more attention,\" Munno says.\nWebsite:https://www.ristorantecesare.com\nAddress: Via Crescenzio, 13, 00193\nPhone: +39 06 686 1227\nTrattoriaDa Teodoesn't feel like an ordinary restaurant – it feels more like a dining room a family graciously opened up to the public.\nDeep in the Trastevere district south of the Vatican, Da Teo is set in a neighbourhood which – in spite of its popularity with tourists – has preserved its medieval charm and a fierce community spirit.\n\"Trastevere is magical,\" Munno says. \"It's a crazy neighbourhood which gives you a whole different experience [and] energy.\"\n\"You have people dancing, clubs, young people, cats,\" she adds. \"The heart and vibe of Rome.\"\nMunno believes Da Teo offers a taste of Trastevere's \"intense, exhilarating Roman vibe\" and recommends going there with a significant other. \"Going [there] with a lover is so romantic,\" she says.\nTossed in an especially thick, creamy homestyle sauce, Da Teo's take on the Roman dish feels less like a restaurant serving and more akin to something your nonna would whip you up for Sunday lunch.\nWebsite:https://m.facebook.com/Trattoria.da.TEO/\nAddress: Piazza dei Ponziani, 7A, 00153\nPhone: +39 06 581 8355\nInstagram:@trattoriadateo\nFlavio al Veloavevodettois perhaps one of the most unique eateries in a city packed with historical oddities, in that it is located quite literally inside an ancient Roman trash heap: the Monte Cocci, a hill made up of discardedamphorae(vases).\n\"It's an incredible experience you can't get anywhere else,\" Munno says.\nIn spite of its remarkable setting, the restaurant nevertheless makes simple, traditional food for a largely local clientele – and, Munno notes, is a great place to experience dishes like cacio e pepe.\n\"[Flavio] has a typical family style,\" Munno says. \"It isn't super fancy.

    "content": "Proud New Yorker chef Calvin Eng is known for his daring reinterpretations of Chinese cuisine. Here's where he goes when he wants homestyle Chinese food, from dim sum to egg tarts.\nThough itsoriginal Chinatownin Lower Manhattan – dating to the 1870s – is the most well-known, New York City is actually home to nine official Chinatowns spread across its five boroughs; each reflecting the rich regional diversity of Chinese cuisine.\nThe city's first Chinatown took root when Chinese immigrants, many from southern China, arrived either directly or relocated from the US's West Coast,fleeing anti-Chinese sentiment. Early businesses were mostly rice shops and teahouses, but by the early 1900s, full-service restaurants emerged, drawing curious diners from all over New York. By the mid-20th Century, Chinese food, in all its glorious forms, had become as associated with New York City as thehumble bagelorthe New York slice.\nAmong the new generation carrying this legacy forward is chefCalvin Eng, the owner ofBonnie's; a Cantonese American restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that has been lauded for its inventive interpretations of Cantonese cuisine. Eng grew up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, learning to cook the food of Guangdong (formerly known as Canton) from his mother, the eponymous Bonnie. Weekends were spent visiting his grandparents on Bayard Street in New York City's Lower Manhattan Chinatown, where he developed a deep connection to the neighbourhood and its food.\n\"There's just so much good food in such a small area,\" Eng says. \"You learn what's worth lining up for and what's best eaten on a subway platform.\" These days, Eng gets his Cantonese fix at a variety of New York's Chinatowns, from Sunset Park to Bensonhurst, each offering its own take on Chinese flavours – from the seafood-heavy dishes of Guangdong to the bold, spicy flavours of Sichuan and Hunan.\nDespite the breadth of regional styles found across the city, Eng's focus remains rooted in the cuisine of southern China. Unlike other styles,Cantonese foodis known for its lightness and simplicity, emphasising fresh ingredients, particularly seafood – a reflection of the region's coastal geography. Heavy spices are rare, and rice – not wheat – is the dominant starch.\n\"Cantonese food is very low on acid and heat,\" Eng explains. \"We use minimal ingredients that allow the main ingredients to shine.\"\nHere are Eng's favourite places to get Chinese food in New York City.\nInsiders know that in Chinatowns across the world, some of the most unassuming places have the best food.Yi Ji Shi Mo– a tiny, below-street-level hole-in-the-wall on Lower Manhattan's Elizabeth Street – is no exception. Here, the specialty is made-to-ordercheung fun;Cantonese-style steamed rice rolls filled with shrimp, beef, pork and other savoury ingredients.\nCheung fun can be found all over New York City's Chinatowns, but Eng says what makes the offerings at Yi Ji Shi Mo stand out is their rice wrapper: it's perfectly thin with a satisfying chew and bounce. \"They mill the rice into flour fresh every morning to make the batter,\" he explains. \"Then they steam it, fill it, roll it up, pop it in a takeout box, give you a packet of their seasoned soy sauce, and you're on your way.\"\nEng eats cheung fun for breakfast, lunch or just a snack whenever he's in the area. The wait can be a bit long since everything is made fresh, but he says it's worth it – or you can try calling ahead. \"My go-to is always the large – which isn't even that large – with beef, scallion and cilantro,\" he says. \"And I just douse it in their soy sauce.\"\nAddress: 88 Elizabeth Street, New York, NY 10013\nPhone: +1 646-233-6311\nA little slice of Xinjian, an autonomous region in north-western China, can be found at the iconicGrand Street Skewer Carton Lower Manhattan's Grand Street.\nThe vendors are a husband-and-wife duo who prepare Xinjian-style meat skewers (yang rou chuan) straight out of a cooler; you can smell the sizzling aroma of roasted lamb and spicy cumin from over a block away, says Eng. \"I don't know what their schedule is, but when they're there, it's a treat, like a special surprise,\" he says. \"If it's raining, snowing or even just a little cold, they're probably not going to be there. But when the weather's nice, you have to take the chance and go.\"\nThe cart is set up just outside a busy train station, and like many commuters, Eng buys a bunch of the inexpensive skewers to eat on the subway ride home to Brooklyn. The selection is impressive: lamb, beef, chicken, fish balls, mushrooms, onions, leeks – even aubergine. \"Whether you get it spicy or not is up to you,\" Eng says, \"but the spicy skewers are very, very tasty.\"\n\"The cart is really special and unique – you don't find anything like it in Chinatown,\" he adds. \"Restaurants aren't doing this kind of thing because it's live fire and not easy to pull off. Getting to experience that on the street is very cool.\"\nAddress: Corner of Grand St and Chrystie Street, New York, NY 10002\nThe Chinese banquet experience is a joyful multi-course feast typically shared at big, round tables to celebrate birthdays, weddings or even just a fun night out with friends. Eng's go-to for a classic banquet isHop Leeon Mott Street; a beloved Chinatown institution since 1973, with all the essentials: oversized tables, lazy Susans and a vast menu.\n\"They have the old-school stuff you can't get all in one place anymore,\" Eng says. Highlights include razor clams in black bean sauce, honey walnut shrimp and a wide variety of chicken dishes: half, whole, poached, fried. But one dish in particular stands out to Eng: the eternally popular Cantonese lobster with pork.\n\"It starts with the Chinese trinity of ginger, garlic and scallions,\" Eng explains. The lobster is broken down Chinese-style, which means it's chopped into 14 easy-to-eat pieces, so there's no need for cracking shells. \"The flavours of the trinity really come through in the wok,\" he says, \"and they stir-fry it with ground pork, which adds this whole extra layer of depth that most lobster dishes just don't have. It's delicious.\"\nWebsite:www.hopleenyc.com/\nAddress: 16 Mott Street, New York, NY 10013\nPhone: +1 212-962-6475\nInstagram:@hop_lee_nyc/\nThroughout the winding streets of Manhattan's Chinatown, roast ducks, chickens and slabs of pork hang in steamy restaurant windows. For Eng,King's Kitchenstands out for serving the best of these iconic barbecued meats. With multiple locations across Manhattan and Brooklyn, the purveyor offers a vast menu, including dim sum, but it's the roasted meats that keep Eng coming back.\n\"Thechar siu(roast pork) is perfectly balanced – sweet and salty, charred and glistening because it's always fresh,\" he says. The marinade, a blend that includes bean paste and Chinese five-spice, is rubbed inside the cavity of the pig, giving the meat deep, rich flavour all the way through.\n\"King's Kitchen does steady business, so they're popping out fresh things all the time,\" Eng adds. \"This way you know the meat is not just sitting there all day.\"\nWebsite:kingskitchenusa.com/\nAddress: 92 East Broadway, New York, NY 10002\nPhone: +1 212-966-7288\nInstagram:@jinhuanggroup/\nWhen he's in the mood for seafood, Eng heads to Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighbourhood to hitBK Seafood Market– a large restaurant with rows of bubbling tanks filled with live fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Diners can pick exactly what they want and have it cooked to order, just minutes from tank to table.\n\"It's a rare opportunity to eat something that was literally swimming two minutes before it was cooked,\" says Eng. One of his favourite orders is king crab prepared three ways, a \"massive feast of king crab\", he says.\nHe also chooses a fresh whole fish and asks for it steamed with soy sauce, ginger and spring onions. \"When the seafood is this fresh, you don't want to ruin it,\" he says. \"Steaming keeps it clean and simple and that's how you taste how good it really is.\"\nWebsite:www.bkseafoodmarketnyc.com/\nAddress: 842 64th St, Brooklyn, NY 11220\nPhone: +1 718-836-6888\nInstagram:@bkseafoodmarket1/\n\"If I want the full dim sum experience, I go for a big location – a place with, like, 1,000 seats,\" says Eng. For that, he heads toPark Asia; a sprawling two-storey space with high ceilings and a bright, bustling vibe. \"It's where I had my son's 100-day party [a celebration marking a child's first 100 days in Chinese culture] with 100 people,\" he says.\nFor Eng, the ideal dim sum restaurant offers the most variety. \"When I get dim sum from a cart, I want a lot of different things on the table,\" he says. And the key to a good spot? \"It should be packed. That means the food's fresh, and nothing's been sitting on the cart for more than half an hour.\"\nThe selection is huge, from porksiu maiand shrimp dumplings to specials that rotate with the seasons. In the evenings, Park Asia shifts into banquet-style dining, but the dim sum crowd is always out in full force – even on a Monday morning.\nWebsite:park-asia.restaurants-world.com/\nAddress: 6521 8th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11220\nPhone: +1 718-833-1688\nInstagram:@parkasiarestaurant/\nFor the best egg tarts in the city, Eng makes a beeline toXin Fa Bakery. But he doesn't just buy one. \"You get a dozen,\" he says. \"They're always hot and always fresh.\"\nThese are the classic Hong Kong-styledan tat– small, flaky tarts filled with silky egg custard. For Eng, the perfect one has a wobble. \"When you bite into it, it should be jiggly and almost fall out of the crust,\" he explains. \"You don't want it to be fully set. And you definitely don't want to see your teeth marks in it.\"\nWebsite:xinfabakery.shop/\nAddress: 5617 8th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11220\nPhone: +1 718-871-2889\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "A weekend in Cannes with an attaché to the stars",
    "content": "Gilles Bastoni is Cannes' celebrity concierge. Here is his tailor-made list for a sublime Cannes getaway – from luxurious star-studded venues to escapes at sea.\nEvery May since 1946, the red carpet has been rolled out onto Cannes' palm-lined boulevards for itsInternational Film Festival, turning the French Riviera resort city into a playground for silver screen stars.\nMuch like the celebrities it attracts, Cannes isn't camera shy: it's a postcard-perfect town bursting with fuchsia bougainvillea and resplendent ivory-hued facades. And as its palatial grand hotels show, the town has been a magnet for the elite long before the dawn of film – prior to entertaining Hollywood royalty, it was the haunt of European nobility.\nThe 2025 edition of the Film Festival, taking place 13-24 May, will bring a set of well-known A-listers, fromTom Cruiseto Robert De Niro, who will recceive the Honorary Palme d'Or for Lifetime Achievement. But you don't need to be of blue blood or billed in a Hollywood blockbuster to enjoy a VIP experience in this jewel-like Côte d'Azur holiday town.\nWe spoke to Gilles Bastoni, the Cannes born-and-bred head concierge of the city's iconic, five-starHôtel Barrière Le Majestic, which is opposite the main venue of the Film Festival and hosts its main VIPs.\nKnown as the \"concierge of the stars\", Bastoni was raised on Cannes' glam. \"My father was head concierge of Le Majestic,\" he says. \"You could say I was nearly born in the hotel.\"\nAs Cannes' celebrity concierge, Bastoni knows a thing or two about demanding clients – and going the extra mile to fulfil their needs.\n\"As a concierge, you always have to be on top of things,\" he says. \"You have to change things again and again, to answer all guests' requests and satisfy them. One time, one celebrity guest forgot their dress in Paris and we had to go pick it up. Another time, we had a very big celebrity who wanted to have a birthday party for their spouse on the boat, and when things didn't work, we needed to find a backup.\" The outcome? \"They became a confidante in the end.\"\nHere are Bastoni's A-list ways to experience Cannes in its full beauty, whether or not you have an invite to the Film Festival.\nFew places better encapsulate the cinematic grandeur of Cannes than its seafront promenade:La Croisette.\n\"La Croisette is incredible,\" Bastoni says, barely able to contain his enthusiasm. \"It's 1km long, full of luxurious brands, beaches and hotels. There aren't many places in the world where you can find such a concentration of luxury.\"\nDesigned in the 19th Century by a British aristocrat, La Croisette is a masterclass of Art Nouveau architecture, with its row of grand hotels — from Bastoni's own Majestic to theJW Marriott,Carlton CannesandHôtel Martinez— as well as luxury boutiques, plush cafes and even shops reselling celebrity memorabilia.\nThe film industry's legacy is palpable here –150 stars' footprints can be found on the promenade.\n\"Come Film Festival, [La Croisette]'s vibe is totally different,\" Bastoni says. \"The road is packed; you have open-air cinemas on the beach.\"\nAddress: Palace of Festivals and Congresses of Cannes, 1 Boulevard de la Croisette 06400\nWebsite:https://www.palaisdesfestivals.com\nPhone number: +33 4 92 99 84 00\nInstagram:@palaisdesfestivals\nCannes may now be synonymous with the glitterati, but it remains a demure Provençal fishing village at its core, and nowhere is this more evident than atLe Suquet, its pocket-sized old town.\nCrowning the bay, Le Suquet is a tight-knit complex of pastel-hued alleyways topped by a castle and church, both built in the 12th Century. In the harbour, small fishing boats and mansion-sized mega yachts glide side by side.\nIt's a welcome break from the brazen opulence of La Croisette. \"Here, you see what Cannes really is,\" Bastoni says. \"It started off as a small fishing town. Everything else was built around it. You still have fisherman in [Le Suquet's] old port.\"\nUp the quarter's cobblestone streets, Le Suquet's Gothic monastery-château and church ofNôtre-Dame-de-l'Espéranceprovide a unique vantage point from which to take in Cannes' panorama.\n\"You can see the sea, the islands. It's a spectacular view,\" Bastoni says.\nAnd for all the energy burnt trekking up to its summit, Le Suquet does not leave its visitors on an empty stomach; its Meynadier Street features delicatessens, restaurants and cafes that have belonged to local families for generations.\nBastoni's pick? \"Le Maschou,\" he says.  \"It's the best restaurant for local food. It's a lowkey place [typical] of the old town.\"\nAddress: Restaurant Le Maschou, 15 Rue Saint-Antoine, 06400\nWebsite:https://www.lemaschou.com/en/\nPhone number: +33 4 93 39 62 21\nInstagram:@lemaschou\nAt the foot of Le Suquet is Cannes' beating heart: theMarché Forville(Forville Market)\n\"You'll want to go see the old town's market,\" Bastoni says, to truly get the feel of the Côte d'Azur life and step into a local's shoes.\nOver in Forville, a sturdy, orange-coloured edifice, the wafting scent of garlic and parsley mix with the catch of the day.\nWhile French cuisine is typically renowned for its fussy, buttery profile, the food of the Côte d'Azur – as Bastoni notes – has a leaner, more fragrant note.\n\"Ours is a Mediterranean cuisine,\" Bastoni says. \"We don't have a lot of heavy, creamy food. Our kitchen has lots of fish, olive oil, vegetables and fresh produce. It's all about freshness and aromatic herbs.\"\nStock up on local specialties fromfougasse– the French cousin of Italy'sfocaccia— tosocca(chickpea pancakes) and a home-madeaioligarlic dip.\nAddress: 6 Rue du Marché Forville, 06400\nWebsite:https://www.marcheforville.com/\nJust off Cannes' Point Croisette peninsula, theLérins Islandsare impossibly idyllic, surrounded by swirling shades of turquoise sea, secluded beaches and covered in lush Mediterranean brush.\nBut their history, Bastoni points out, is decidedly less dreamlike.\n\"The first and biggest island, Île Sainte-Marguerite, used to be a prison,\" he says.\nIndeed, the 17th-Century Fort Royal – perched on the side of Sainte-Marguerite – was contested between the Spanish and the French, and once hosted many noteworthy inmates, including Louis XIV's Man in the Iron Mask.\nThings take a holier turn in the neighbouring île Saint-Honorat, where 21 monks live in a 5th-Century Cistercian Abbey.\n\"The monks even have their own winery,\" Bastoni says – one that dates back 1,000 years.\nAs Bastoni remarks, the islands make for the perfect out-of-town excursion providing scenic natural trails with a history lesson on the side. And while they maintain their unspoilt, rustic appearance, the islands are not immune from high-profile incursions – meaning you might spot a celebrity in the wild.\n\"Over at [Sainte-Marguerite]'sLa Guérite restaurant,you have Elton John as a customer,\" Bastoni says. \"He went two years in a row.\"\nA weekend in the French Riviera would not be complete without nighttime revelry – and, with its sunset-primed views over the sweeping bay and Le Suquet,Medusaoffers the perfect location for a glam night on the town.\n\"Medusa is a restaurant that turns into a club,\" Bastoni says, much like many other beachfront clubs in the town. Located on Point Croisette, Medusa attracts throngs of tourists because of its now-legendary reputation as a premier venue. But it's also renowned for its Mediterranean-Asian fusion food, made by Greek chefYannis Kioroglou.\nWith an entrance fee of €55 Medusa isn't for those on a budget. And younger clientele may eschew Medusa for hip clubs likeBâoliandBisous Bisous,which play house music.\nBut Medusa, for Bastoni, remains iconic, for one reason: \"It's the cabaret show,\" he says, which starts as the restaurant metamorphoses into a club.\nAnd it's not just any cabaret. With pyrotechnics and elaborate costumes, Medusa's shows do not skimp on high production values.\n\"Medusa is just a beautiful place,\" Bastoni says.\nWebsite:https://medusacannes.com\nAddress: Palm Beach, Place Franklin Roosevelt, 06400\nInstagram:@medusa_cannes\nThis article was originally published in May 2024 and has since been updated.\n\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "A White Lotus actor's guide to Thailand",
    "content": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimedfilm productionsandinfluential namesdrawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, fromfashiontosportstoentertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's seriesThe White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink'sLisa Manobal,Patravadi Mejudhon,Tayme Thapthimthongand actor, model and businessmanDom Hetrakuljoin the star-studded cast.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui.\nHome to theFour Seasons Resort Koh Samuiwhere much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed,Koh Samuiis perhaps the ultimate White Lotusset-jettingdestination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night – daytime, office hours – we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likesSummer by Coco Tam,The ShackandGusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt,Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish andyum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui – and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns – you name it – Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in thetrailer.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot isKo Pha Nganisland, about 38km from Koh Samui – eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for theFull Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds – the parties attract thousands of attendants – Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies theMu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available onKo Wua Talap, the park's largest island,  Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommendedTa Khairestaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to theAnantara Mai Khao Phuketresort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach – Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest calledBaan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such asmee hokkien(chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional – truly local – food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titledGrand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\nAs a sports enthusiast – he practices Muay Thai – Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan ofUFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand – \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says – the actor recommends stopping by theRajadamnern Stadiumin his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring – the only one of its kind in the world.\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite:\nhttps://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram:\n@rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 onUnesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist templeWat Pho, credited as thebirthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\nAs home to theWatpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\n*This article, originally published on 26 February 2025, provides a companion to fans tuning into the Season 3 finale on 6 April.\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food",
    "content": "Chef Ruben Bondì knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church,in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving – and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bondì, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, thetradizione giudaico-romanesca(Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset ofRoman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bondì, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes – expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy – fromcarciofi alla giudia(fried artichokes) tostracotto(braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bondì says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing – typical [Jewish] dishes likeconcia di zucchine[marinated fried courgettes] andabbacchio[roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history – from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 – Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bondì says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so]the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto – sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace – is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bondì's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near theTempio Maggiore synagogueandPorticus Octaviae– the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol –Ba'Ghettois just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bondì says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples iscarciofi alla giudia– a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes likespaghetti alla carbonaraand bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bondì says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches inVenice,FlorenceandMilan. Its main restaurant – a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures – does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearbyBa'Ghetto Milky.\nWebsite:https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram:@baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institutionRenato al Ghetto– where Bondì worked as a waiter in his younger days – realised it could replicate its success with street food, its hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosetteare a type of Roman bap,\" Bondì says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beefstracottoor Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chickenalla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under €12 (£10).\n\"It's very good,\" Bondì says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S. Maria del Pianto, 63, 00186\nPhone: +39 338 859 3395\nInstagram:@rosetteria_renato_al_ghetto\n\"Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,\" Ruben says. \"And for meat lovers, I recommendBellaCarne.\"\nLocated a mere block from the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, the restaurant's name itself is particularly promising – translating literally to \"Beautiful Meat\" – and its dishes definitely live up to expectations.\n\"I can especially vouch for their grilled meats,\" Bondì says, which includescottaditolamb and veal chops.\n\n\nBut while meat in all its forms – roast, fried, stewed and braised – is the undeniable star, it isn't the only thing worth ordering.\n\"They have an excellent vegan crostata [tart] for dessert,\" Bondì says, made with almond paste and sour cherries.\nRoman Jewish food may be humble by nature, but BellaCarne offers a decidedly refined dining experience, set in a chic, wood-panelled interior. As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.bellacarne.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 51, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 683 3104\nInstagram:\n@bellacarne/\nThe dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expresslycasereccio –homestyle, homemade.\nCasalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.\n\"It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,\" Bondì says.\nThe restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successfulDolce Kosherbakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.\nAmong its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia. Bondì emphatically recommends Casalino's roasts, but notes that the Zarfati family tightly guards the recipe.\n\"It's a secret,\" he says.\nWebsite:https://casalinoosteriakosher.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 1e, 00186\nPhone number: +39 06 7978 1514\nInstagram:@casalino.osteriakosher/\nWhile most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together),Il Giardino Romanohas adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate.\n\"It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,\" Bondì says.\nAs its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (\"The Roman Garden\") has a green thumb – its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which Bondì calls the restaurant's speciality.\nThe mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use – fromfettuccinealle vongole(pasta with clams) tocacio e pepeto even more idiosyncratic pairings.\n\"[Il Giardino Romano] has a particularly unique dessert,\" Bondì says. \"A ricotta crostata with artichoke.\"\nAnd if the menu does not succeed in evoking the bucolic delights of the Roman orchard, its setting certainly will – the restaurant has a small brick courtyard covered in trees and hanging ivy.\nWebsite:https://www.ilgiardinoromano.com\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia 18, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 6880 9661\nInstagram:@ristorante_il_giardino_romano/\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "The Indian Ocean's laid-back 'paradise on Earth'",
    "content": "Famous for its adorable quokkas, Rottnest Island has become a global favourite. But beyond the selfies lies a rich, complex story of culture, conservation and community.\nOn a recent visit to Perth, I mentioned to a local that I was heading to Rottnest Island the next day. She sighed wistfully. \"I love it there,\" she said. \"You're going to love it too. It has a special kind of magic – the kind of place where you kick off your shoes the minute you arrive. Everything slows down and you can breathe a little more deeply.\"\nI already felt that Perth was a little like that – at least, life there felt slower and less frenzied than in my hometown of Melbourne on Australia's east coast – but I smiled back, notreallyknowing what she meant.\nHowever, she was right.Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-sq-km isle off the coast of Western Australia, is, in fact, magical. The spell was cast as soon as our ferry left the mainland, skimming over the Indian Ocean. Humpback whales breached nearby, sending jets of sea spray into the air and flipping their tails as if in welcome. The sky was clear with the promise of a perfect day to come.\nJust 19km and 30 minutes later, I stepped off the ferry into another world. Rottnest Island has been famously car-free since 1931, and those more in the know than me immediately jumped onto bikes they'd brought with them or wandered off to hire one from Pedal and Flipper, said to bethe largest bike hire place in the southern hemisphere.\nKids zoomed around in packs, dodging groups of tourists ambling through the main settlement. Some people had fishing rods under one arm; others, surfboards strapped to their bikes. Families stopped at the bakery for a flat white andvanilla slicebefore heading off to explore the island's 63 beaches and 20 bays, many with evocative names likeLittle Parakeet BayandCathedral Rocksthat in no way came close to capturing the grandeur of the scenery in real life.\nThere was no urban noise, no traffic and nothing to worry about. It was idyllic and glorious and everything I imagined a nostalgic care-free (and car-free) island holiday to be.\nThe isle has long been a cherished playground for generations of Western Australian families. \"Rottnest is very, very special, particularly to the people of Perth, like me,\" explained Paul Campbell, a volunteer guide I met not long after I arrived. Campbell spent his childhood holidays on Rottnest and now returns regularly to tell people about his beloved island. \"There are no multi-storey high-rise hotels here,\" he added. \"There is no private ownership. If you ever tried to put a multi-storey-anything here for wealthy people, you would be absolutely torn to shreds. We are very protective of our beautiful island.\"\nOnce a well-kept secret from the rest of the world, in recent years Rottnest has become one of Australia's most Instagrammed destinations, thanks to a certain fuzzy-faced resident: the quokka.\nIn 2013, Huffington Post dubbed the quokka \"the happiest animal in the world\", and the internet responded in glee. Quokkas – tiny marsupials found only in this small pocket of south-western Australia – seem to smile for selfies in a way that feels almost staged. Tennis starRoger Federerto actressMargot Robbiewere among the first celebrities to pose with the infamous animal, helping spark a wave of global attention. Then in 2019 came Chris Hemsworth's now-iconic#QuokkaSelfiewith Matt Damon, which racked up more than four million likes. \"Rotto\", as locals call it, became the hottest ticket in town, transforming from local secret to global sensation. According to the Rottnest Island Authority, annual visitor numbers have nearly tripled in the last decade, peaking at more than 800,000 at last count.\nRottnest, once simple and sleepy, has had to quickly grow up to meet the demands of all these domestic and international tourists. That meant creating more accommodation than the basic cabins and camping that existed, as well as better food and activity options. And what it has done is exemplary, transforming into a model of eco-conscious tourism without losing its soul.\nAs Campbell put it: \"When I was nine years old, the [cultural] experience that I had on Rottnest is not that much different to what you're going to experience today.\"\nYou won't find any private cars here – just a few vehicles for rangers and staff – so most everyone gets about on two wheels or two feet (or the odd skateboard, scooter or Segway), having to occasionally dodge quokkas lounging on the road. Accommodation ranges from beachside cottages with bike racks out front to backpacker dorms to relaxed boutique hotels. While many tourists come on a day trip from Perth, it's much better to stay the night: quokkas are nocturnal and will spend most of the day sleeping under shady bushes. In addition, most day-trippers leave by 16:30, at which point the island truly comes into its own.\n\"Someone once said to me that you can feel the island exhale [when they leave],\" said Erin Gallagher from the Rottnest Island Authority. \"I just thought it was the most beautiful thing – and it's so true.\"\nI was staying atDiscovery Resorts, the island's first eco resort, whose 83 glamping tents are shaded by gum trees and Aleppo pines, tucked behindPinky Beachin the sand dunes. My tent had no aircon or TV, just a ceiling fan for airflow and the sound of the ocean through canvas walls. It was perfect in its simplicity. \"[The resort] is designed to immerse guests into the environment,\" explained Krizza Miclat, the resort's sales and event manager. \"A lot of the infrastructure is elevated on steel poles to ensure that we're not damaging the sand dunes. So, if ever we were to pick up and move, we haven't impacted it too much.\"\nIn fact, nearly everything here works in harmony with the natural environment. Renewable energy is provided by the Indian Ocean's sea breezes and the strong Western Australian sun; while drinking water is drawn from the sweeping white semi-circle ofLongreach Bay, desalinated and filtered.Marine sanctuary zonesbelow water mean world-class snorkelling and diving, and anisland nurserygrows native plants from locally sourced cuttings and seeds. In 2023, a newmanagement planreaffirmed Rottnest's commitment to sustainability, conservation and culture.\n\"We're always striving to improve,\" said Gallagher. \"Our target is to achieve 75% renewables. There's even an app where anyone can see how much power the island is generating in real time.\"\nMore like this:\n•A day out with Bluey: Australia's new experience brings the Heeler family to life\n•Bindi Irwin's top outdoor adventures in Australia\n•The hike making Australia a better place\nIn the spirit of low-impact activities, I decided to take a Segway tour around the undulating landscape, rolling along the endless beaches, gliding past the cluster of salt lakes in the north-eastern corner and looking out for whales on the island'sHumpback Highway. I steered past the scrub heath that covers much of the island, breathing in its signature salty-sweet smell and dodging prickle lily and feather speargrass. The island is just 11km long and 4.5km at its widest point, but its biodiversity is vast – a Class A reserve where everything from the blue-flowered Rottnest daisy to the long, black king skink I saw on the side of a trail is protected.\nBut not all scenes here are so idyllic.\nIn 1838, Rottnest was turned into an Aboriginal prison. Over the next century, more than 4,000 Indigenous men and boys were incarcerated here for \"crimes\" that they often didn't know they'd committed. Some were as young as eight years old. Many never returned home.\nIt's a dark legacy that the island is only beginning to address. As I wobbled my Segway back to the main settlement, we passed what looked like an ordinary field. But, my tour guide explained, it is a place of immense significance: theWadjemup Aboriginal Burial Groundwhere 373 unmarked graves of prisoners were uncovered, with the first discoveries made during construction work in the 1970s. Shockingly, holidaymakers continued to camp on the site until the practice was finally banned in 2007.\n\"It was the largest number of Aboriginal deaths in custody in history in Australia,\" explained volunteer guide Anne Yardley, when I met her later at the island'sWadjemup Museum. \"And from the biggest number of Aboriginal nations.\"\nBut Indigenous connection to the island stretches far beyond this painful chapter. Long before European settlement, the island was part of the mainland, and archaeological evidence shows that the Noongar people lived on and used the island for tens of thousands of years. Its Indigenous name – Wadjemup – means \"place of spirits\".\n\"This was a significant place for Indigenous people,\" Campbell told me. \"Ceremonies were held here. But about 6,500 years ago, sea levels rose and this patch of land became an island. The Aboriginal people stayed on the mainland and it was left alone for thousands of years… all through Christianity, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire… until Europeans arrived.\"\nToday, Wadjemup is working to tell this fuller story. The small but compelling Wadjemup Museum has been revamped; while walking trails such as the 45kmWadjemup Bidi– made up of five connected trails and built in part by volunteers – connects visitors to historical and cultural sites across the landscape, with interpretive signage and installations by Noongar artists. TheWadjemup Project, an Aboriginal-led initiative, focusses on acknowledging Wadjemup's history of Aboriginal incarceration and the memorialisation of former prison sites.\nVolunteers play a huge part, too, from the Winnit Club, formed in 1931 by a group of regular campers, to the yellow-shirted Rottnest Volunteer Guides. These and other groups collectively contribute more than 40,000 hours a year to maintaining the island, and their dedication to preserving and sharing its stories speaks volumes about how deeply the island is loved.\n\"There's this balancing act between having enough people to make the place work financially, but not so many people coming here that you lose the reason to come,\" said Campbell. \"It is a very, very special place.\"\nI certainly felt that on my visit. One moment I was riding my bike past salt lakes ringed with grey saltbush and coastal pigface, the next watching irresistibly cute quokkas hop around at sunset. I snorkelled an underwater trail through turquoise shallows, gazed onto shipwrecks just offshore and had sunset drinks looking out to incredible ocean vistas. I even tried to get my own quokka selfie, respecting the signs not to feed or touch them in any way but to keep my distance and let them come to me. I laughed as I tried – and failed – to get both myself and a quokka fully in shot, and was reminded of something Gallagher had said to me about the smiling-faced marsupial: \"Why wouldn't you be happy if this is where you lived?\"\nIt was more than just a line – it was a truth that settled into the bones of the island. Rottnest may be famous now, but it hasn't lost what makes it feel like a local secret: the sense that once you arrive, you can slow down, breathe deeply and kick off your shoes for a while. "

    "title": "Paul Feig's top cocktail bars around the world",
    "content": "He's always viewed cocktails as the key to the glamorous adult world – in real life and his famously daring films. Here are the director's favourite cocktail spots, from Capri to Burbank.\nPaul Feig – the perennially well-dressed director of Bridesmaids (2011) and A Simple Favor (2018) – has become almost as well-known for his love of cocktails as he is for his films.\n\"Try to find one of my movies where somebody's not drinking a martini,\" he jokes.\nThe BBC caught up with Feig as he prepared for the launch of Another Simple Favor, premiering 1 May on Amazon Prime Video. The film sees the return of Blake Lively's murderous, martini-swilling Emily and Anna Kendrick's prim Stephanie for more sensual backstabbing – this time against the opulent backdrop of Capri'sGrand Hotel Quisisana.\nNot so incidentally, the Grand Hotel Quisisana is also home to one of Feig's favourite cocktail bars.\nBut for Feig, beautiful cocktails are more than a silent film character; they are the \"greatest perks\" of the adult world.\n\"I didn't like the power dynamics of being a kid,\" explains Feig. \"I've always been obsessed with the culture of cocktails; the look of cocktails, the glassware, the mixology. It is all, to me, so beautiful.\"\nFeig believes that cocktails should always be a special moment, even if partaking at home. \"You should be wearing the right thing and have the right glass,\" he says. \"So much stuff in our culture now is for kids or trying to stay young which is fine. But being an adult is awesome. It's got its hard parts. That's why you need cocktails.\"\nAnd when he's jet-setting, Feig keeps the special occasion going, seeking out the world's top cocktail bars.\n\"I do a little research,\" he says. \"I always want to find the nicest one. I have an obsession with hotel bars... but I'll do my research and ask people; find out what they recommend as far as what I'm looking for.\"\nAnd Feig is looking for something specific.\n\"It has to be very beautiful,\" he says. \"Beautiful wood and beautiful appointments; the way they display the bottles; bartenders who are absolute professionals. I look for a good aesthetic experience with knowledgeable bartenders.\"\nHaving an adult-style tipple, he notes, can also get you a front-row seat to a new city's culture. \"Having a drink definitely tends to loosen me up,\" he says. \"I think it connects you with the group of people that might lead you to other things that you are looking for; nice restaurants and cool places to shop. I love finding the cool places to shop. I love all that stuff.\"\nHere are Feig's favourite very beautiful, very grown-up cocktail bars around the world.\nFeig's favourite cocktail on-and-off screen is forever the martini – so he holds his bartenders to a high standard. \"Honestly, I'm very prejudiced about that,\" he admits. \"If they go 'gin or vodka?' I'm always, like, 'I said a martini, I didn't say a vodka martini.' It's so fluid now with people having vodka or gin martinis. But I'm a purist. I do hold that against a bartender occasionally.\"\nBut Feig never has cause to judge when he visits the historicDUKES Bar, located in London's upscale St James's neighbourhood.\n\"It's a very small bar. It looks like grandma's living room,\" he says of the cosy space outfitted with heavy club chairs; opened in 1908. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see people from Parliament walk in there. It's got that vibe. They have a dress code, which I love. And it's where Ian Fleming discovered the martini, supposedly. So, it's got a little James Bond DNA on top of it.\"\nFor Feig, what truly makes the DUKES experience is the personable and highly knowledgeable staff – led byAlessandro Palazzi, who Feig calls his \"cocktail hero\" and a \"really close friend\".\n\"What they specialise in is martinis that don't touch ice, so they're the coldest martinis you can get,\" says Feig. \"They bring out the frozen glasses, the frozen bottle of gin. They take vermouth – which is not frozen – but they put it into the glass, swirl it around just to coat the edges, and then they dump it out on the floor, so you just have the very thin coat. Then right from the frozen bottle, they pour in the gin. So it's freezing cold; there's no excuse for [a] martini that's not ice-cold.\"\nFeig notes that because the martini never touches ice, it's undiluted: \"They limit you to two, because you'll pass out if you go beyond that.\" Feig also applauds Palazzi's \"great\"vespersand \"amazing\" Manhattans. \"You can get whatever you want, but that is the temple of the martini.\"\nWebsite:www.dukeshotel.com/dukesbar.html\nAddress: 35 St James's Pl, London SW1A 1NY\nPhone: +442074914840\nInstagram:@dukeslondon\nTheGrand Hotel Quisisanais located on the island of Capri, which Feig and his wife, Laurie, have visited \"religiously\" once a year for the past 30 years. \"Capri is my favourite place in the world,\" says Feig. \"Even when we're not staying at the Quisisana, we go there for drinks because I love the bar inside.\"\nBuilt in 1845, the Grand Hotel Quisisana sits at the start of the bougainvillea-draped, luxury-boutique-lined Via Camerelle, catching the tourist overflow from Piazza Umberto I. The hotel's marble lobby leads to opulent, Vietri-tiled guestrooms. Just past the lobby is Quisi Bar, which serves all manners of apertifs, and whose splendid street-level terrace has entertained royalty, politicians and artistic luminaries from Oscar Wilde to Jackie Kennedy.\n\"The best part is sitting out front, especially on that patio,\" says Feig. \"Everything in Capri comes past there.…  and you will people watch. It's just magical. You become a real Caprese local when you're sitting up there.\"\nWhen in Capri, Feig – who built hotel rooms on the set of Another Simple Favor to resemble those at the Quisisana – veers from his usual martinis and opts for aspritz;Aperolor limoncello. And he particularly enjoys the Italian custom of the early eveningaperitivo, where bar snacks like olives, finger sandwiches and crisps are served along with the drinks.\n\"It's, like, 'oh, here – eat!',” says Feig. \"I wrote in my cocktail book, 'Should you serve food at your cocktail party?' And yes, unless you're a monster, don't serve people cocktails with no food! It's that Italian ethos.\"\nWebsite:https://www.quisisana.com/s\nAddress: Via Camerelle, 2, 80073 Capri NA\nPhone: +390818370788\nInstagram:@quisisanacapri/\nWhen not travelling the globe for work (and martinis), Feig is often in New York City where he has a residence on the Upper East Side – and firm favourite neighbourhood cocktail joints.\n\"Bemelmans[Bar] is an institution,\" he says, \"It's in theCarlyle Hotel, which is one of the most famous hotels of opulence [in] the Upper East Side in New York.\"\nBemelmans, originally opened in 1947 and beloved for its Art Deco decor, epitomises \"old\" New York for Feig. \"I love history. I love old bars,\" he says. \"The wall's been painted by [Austrian American writer Ludwig] Bemelmans. He did all the artwork for [the children’s book series] Madeline. Back in the day, he painted all the walls with his cartoons, and so that gives it this real New York history.\"\nLike Feig, visitors to the bar will find themselves transported by the childlike murals on the walls – uplit against mahogany tables and rich leather tufted booths – as they enjoy elegant cocktails and live jazz.\nBut how's their martini?\n\"They make great martinis there with aside car, which I love,\" says Feig. \"There's a whole thing going on now in martini culture of bartenders coming over when you're halfway through a martini and bringing out a new cold, frozen glass and transferring what's left of your martini, which I think is so brilliant. Why don't we do that all the time?\"\nFeig is also a fan of the Bemelmans' waitstaff. \"I've befriended many because I've been going there for so many years,\" he says. \"It always was hard to get in. But then there was a period about two years ago where a lot of young influencers discovered it and then it went nuts. But I've been coming there so long I kind of go, 'Hey. It's me.'\"\n\"It's New York to me; the best of old New York,\" he adds. \"It's one of those places where you feel like you've walked into a New Yorker cartoon, basically.\"\nWebsite:https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/the-carlyle-new-york/dining/bemelmans-bar\nAddress: 35 E 76th St, New York, NY 10021\nPhone: +12127441600\nInstagram:@rosewoodthecarlyle/\n\"Oh, I loveThe Polo Barso much,\" says Feig fondly. \"It'snewold New York.\"\nThe eponymous cocktail bar helmed by fashion designer and philanthropistRalph Laurenis on New York City's East 55th Street just off Fifth Avenue, one of Manhattan's swankiest shopping streets. \"It's got the Ralph aesthetic,\" says Feig. \"It's all wood and mirrors and paintings everywhere, and leather. And then, if you go up the stairs in the back, there's a parlour where you can sit in front of a fireplace, and there's a bunch of tables in there to have cocktails.\"\nAt The Polo Bar, the bar staff prepares a stirred martini.\n\"Unless you ask them to shake it,\" notes Feig. \"I'm a personal fan of stirred martinis, because so many bartenders pride themselves on shaking a martini to death, which is the worst way to do a martini, as far as I'm concerned, because it just clouds it up with ice chips. The glassware is all Ralph Lauren glassware, so if you order an old fashioned or whiskey, it comes in a beautiful old fashioned Ralph Lauren glass with the polo horses on the front. Even the stirrers are little polo mallets. The attention to detail is so spot on, and the way that the bottles are displayed; they're uplit from beneath, so they glow.\"\nAnd after enjoying perfectly stirred martinis, guests can retire downstairs to The Polo Bar Restaurant. \"The food is fantastic,\" says Feig. \"It's all very American food. They make an amazing hamburger, but it's served so beautifully. But the cocktail bar really is the linchpin of the whole thing. It's all very mature and very aesthetically fantastic.\"\nWebsite:www.ralphlauren.com/global-polo-bar\nAddress: 1 E 55th St, New York, NY 10022\nPhone: +12122078562\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/poloralphlauren/\nBurbank, California, is Feig's other hometown in the United States – and it's also home toSmoke House, a restaurant and bar for which Feig's love has been well-documented.\n\"Smoke House is quintessential Americana,\" says Feig. \"I have a love of dark wood and red leather, which is what bars used to be in America for a long time. In Europe where you drink, there's windows and there's light. In America, you drink in the dark. I think it's our American puritanism.\"\nFor Feig, the Smoke House's moody interiors evoke the glamorous heyday of the Rat Pack: \"Frank Sinatra and Vegas… everybody's cool, everybody's in tuxedos and suits and gowns. The Smoke House is a time capsule of what that was.\"\nBut Feig notes that for all the bar's celebrity cache – it's located across the street from Warner Brothers, Universal and Disney Studios – he loves that the crowd is surprisingly down-to-earth. \"It's got a very populist crowd in there,\" he says. \"So it's got this great vibe of being old timey, but also very welcoming and not exclusive, which is lovely.\"\nThe bar area hosts live music the second half of the week and visitors can enjoy the restaurant's famous garlic bread and hot wings. \"I'm a buffalo wing fanatic. They've got great ones there,\" says Feig. Most importantly, they serve a \"great\" martini: \"They have really good bartenders who, if you ask for a dry martini, they know how to make a dry martini.\"\n\"It's just fun,\" adds Feig. \"It's really not pretentious but brings along the old-fashioned fun of adulthood.\"\nWebsite:www.smokehouse1946.com/\nAddress: 4420 Lakeside Dr, Burbank, CA 91505\nPhone: +18188453731\nInstagram:@smokehouse1946/\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "Islas Marías: A notorious prison island turned natural paradise",
    "content": "In 2019, Mexico's Islas Marías prison – the last island penal colony in the Americas – finally closed. Now a biosphere reserve, the once-feared archipelago is open to tourists on restricted, navy-organised tours.\nI was at the ferry port in San Blas, a coastal town in western Mexico's Nayarit state, when two men wearing fatigues and carrying machine guns passed me in the queue. Next came a guard leading an Alsatian, which diligently sniffed my backpack. Along with a few hundred middle-aged Mexican tourists, I was about to board a weekend tour organised by the Mexican navy to María Madre, the largest island in the Islas Marías archipelago – once known as the \"Alcatraz of Mexico\".\nUnbeknownst to me at the time, my trip came just before US President Trump ordered his government toreopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco whose operations were formally shuttered in 1963. Alcatraz has since become a major tourist attraction where visitors can experience the historic cellhouse as it once was, and Mexico's own notorious former prison similarly allows tourists to peruse its cells. Unlike Alcatraz, however, the Mexican island has been transformed into a remarkable place of conservation.\nLocated about 130km from the Mexican mainland, María Madre spans around 145 sq km and is part of a four-island nature reserve that's now managed by Mexico's navy. Since 2022, tourists have been allowed to visit via four-hour ferry trips from San Blas and Mazatlán city, exploring designated areas under supervision.\nFor many Mexicans, Islas Marías needs no introduction. The prison, founded in 1905, housed mass murderers and was the setting for the prolific Mexican director Emilio Fernández's 1951 film Las Islas Marías.\n\"They used to have the big shots here, the big criminals,\" said fellow passenger Francisco Espinosa, who told me was drawn to the tour by the film, which shows the island's beaches and salt flats that prisoners worked on. \"It's like Alcatraz. Everybody knew about this prison.\"\nThe island is prone to extreme wind and a military base operates there, so we were compelled to watch a safety video about what to do if the island suffers a tsunami or gas attack (for the latter, cover your nose and run). After the video, I glimpsed huge sea turtles breaching the ocean surface from the ferry window.\nThe natural spectacle continued after we walked over María Madre's concrete jetty and dropped our bags in the hotel complex created for the new visitors. Herds of wild goats scattered from the pathways between restaurant buffet buildings and little gift shops as the incoming humans interrupted their wandering. The sound of hooves on concrete dovetailed with the burble of water crashing from a large waterfall-style water feature, plus loud squawks emanating from trees overhead.\nOne of our guides explained that the squawks signalled mating season for the green Tres Marías amazon parrots that are endemic to the island. Prisoners used to get family members to smuggle these prized parrots to the mainland, to sell. The boa population also took a hit as prisoners caught snakes to make belts from their skin.\nI was assigned an airy, white-painted villa, which guides said used to house prisoners. They explained that some prisoners were allowed to have their families live with them on the island and could roam relatively freely. However, life wasn't open and breezy for all, with many forced to work in sweltering heat on salt flats or shrimp farms. In 2022 an ex-prisoner told theLos Angeles Timesthat she remembered five bathrooms being shared by 500 female prisoners. \"We lived in a chicken coop,\" she said.\nBut in 2010, when the prison was still open, Unesco declaredIslas Marias a biosphere reserve, noting the biological wealth found in the \"dry forests of its landscape, in the mangroves, the succulent rosette scrubland, the reefs, coasts and pelagic environments it harbours\". As well as the contraband parrots, the island is home to 18 other endemic species, including raccoons and rabbits. Mexico's National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) is charged with protecting the delicate ecosystem, which developed in isolation for more than eight million years, while the navy-run tours take visitors through the abandoned prison buildings and educates them on the flora and fauna.\n\"This is tourism for excursions, to explore, to live with nature,\" said Mexico's then-president Lopez Obrador in 2022. \"What was a hell is becoming a paradise.\"\nStill, most tourists come for the history, not the animals. I joined a group hike where our guide pointed out a rusty metal structure near a cliff edge. It looked like a sentry box but was in fact a torture cabinet for errant prisoners, positioned to become hellishly heated by the morning Sun. Tourists took turns climbing inside and pulling its squeaky door shut.\nAfter a buffet meal soundtracked by piped saxophone renditions of Elton John songs, a bus took us over dusty roads to the former maximum-security prison complex. As we approached the vast grey buildings, past fencing topped with rolls of barbed wire, Macarena blasted from the bus speakers.\nIn 2006, after the Mexican government declared war against the country's drug cartels, the prison island changed from a relatively \"open\" prison to a more standard penitentiary. In 2011, a maximum-security section opened with a design based on US prisons: shiny steel tables, chairs and toilets, clanking metal doors and small cells with bunk beds. Fellow tourists thrust their arms between metal bars, posing for photos. Our guide said that there was a riot here in 2013 due to prisoners being riled about rations, and the section shuttered soon afterwards. Now wild goats canter between the unmanned watch towers.\nBut before the island housed a high-security prison, it served as a place of exile for petty criminals and \"undesirables\". President Álvaro Obregón began shipping political opponents here in 1910, and in the 1920s, it housed Catholic supporters rounded up in the Cristero War (1926-29).\nOne of its most notable political prisoners was writer and activist José Revueltas, who was sent to the island twice in the 1930s. He was a member of the Mexican Communist Party declared illegal by the government and was convicted after attending a union strike. A mural of the bespectacled, long-goateed Revueltas adorns the wall of the hotel check-in building.\nLater, the bus took us to a Sun-blasted graveyard flanked by huge cacti, where we paused by a white cross. This was the tomb of José Ortiz Muñoz – known as \"El Sapo aka The Toad\" – an alleged former government assassin who was brought to the island in the 1960s after reportedly killing hundreds of people. He was murdered by fellow prisoners wielding machetes. A guide pulled out her phone to playEl Sapo, a jaunty song by the singer Chalino Sánchez. An iguana skittered from the neighbouring tomb's surface, its tail disappearing under tiles.\nMore like this:\n•Mexico's controversial new 'superhighway'\n•Brazil's prison island turned paradise\n•Pachucos: The Latinx subculture that defied the US\nReports from former Islas Marías residents suggest that less well-known killings also took place on the islands. In 2004, an island chaplain named Francisco Ornelaswrote: \"It is rumoured – and rumours are a profession here – that people who were disappeared are buried on the other three islands, which are now deserted but for the visits of illegal fishermen and drug traffickers.\"\nAccess to the waters around Islas Marías was restricted after María Madre became a penal colony in 1905. Fishing was further limited in 2000 when the area was declared a bioreserve by Mexican authorities, ahead of Unesco's declaration in 2010. In 2021, fishing restrictions were tightened again, with all commercial fishing without a permit from the navy banned in the area.\nHowever, conservationists say that illegal fishing hasn't been effectively cracked down on by authorities. Octavio Aburto-Oropeza, a marine conservationist and professor at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, echoed this when I spoke to him after the tour. \"I know companies that offer not only recreational fishing [around Islas Marías], also spear fishing,\" he said.\nAburto-Oropeza has dived the waters around Islas Marías on two separate trips, and says that while illegal fishing remains a concern, the reefs and wider marine ecosystem are in good shape, largely due to the archipelago's isolation and low visitor numbers.\nHe believes that the navy and CONANP should do more to tackle illegal fishing and set tangible goals for reef and species restoration, but that responsible tourism could also help. \"You can create a vision of tourism on the reefs with a certain capacity,\" he said. \"Touristic activities, especially diving, could help enforce conservation projects.\"\nI hope to return – perhaps to dive, or explore more land sites. A guide showed me photos of buildings that are currently off-limits, including derelict rooms filled with quirky octopus sculptures made by prisoners. In time these buildings might be certified safe to visit, she said.\nOn the ferry back to San Blas, I chatted to fellow passengers about parrots, torture boxes and the surreal experience of stepping into \"Mexico's Alcatraz\". Not one said the prison should re-open. "

    "title": "Chriselle Lim's self-care guide will have you googling flights to Seoul",
    "content": "She jets around the world for her high-profile beauty career, but her heart is in Seoul. Here are her top K-beauty experiences in town, from face lasers to body scrubs.\nFor Chriselle Lim – style guru,digital creatorand creative director ofPHLURfragrances – self-care is a way of life. Especially when she visits South Korea, the birthplace of the viral \"K-beauty\"–  beloved for its multi-layer \"glass skin\" skincare regimens and high-tech sun creams.\n\"Beauty and self-care in Korea is a daily thing,\" says the fresh-faced and flawlessly stylish Lim, who spent her formative years in the glamorous South Korean capital and returns with her daughters each year. \"It's not about hitting a certain age and then taking care of your skin. You just do it since you're a very young girl. As we're trying to reverse [sun damage] here in the States, in Korea, the women have been taught to protect themselves early on. We were always embarrassed about our moms taking us around in their crazy massive sun hats and their gloves. But now I get it. I've become that lady.\"\nWhile innovative Korean products likecollagen sheet maskscontinue to dominate the international market, Korea is also seeing an uptick inbeauty tourism.Consumers can visit \"skin clinics\" for medical aesthetic treatments powered by ultra-modern Korean technologies; often not yet approved by the FDA. Adding to the appeal, patients can get several treatments – from Botox toTitanium skin liftingtoliquid laser sun spot removal– in one sitting with jaw-dropping transformations and little downtime – compared to Western protocols, which require patients wait 28 days between treatments.\n\"I have a lot of followers that ask me for tips and where to go,\" says Lim. \"It makes a lot of sense. One, the technology is there. And two, it's so much cheaper [than the US], at least by five times. The flight there, renting an Airbnb or a hotel; it actually makes a lot of sense because you are saving money in the long run.\"\nNot that Lim ever needs a reason to visit Seoul. \"It's a fast-paced city that is extremely clean, chic, sophisticated,\" she says. \"Just imagine fashion and art and beauty all combined in one. It's one of those places I go whenever I'm feeling like I need inspiration.\"\nHere is Lim's go-to plan for a self-care holiday in Seoul.\nGangnam, the stylish district made world-famous by acertain 2012 K-pop song, is consideredSeoul's K-beauty and medical tourism hot spot– and it's where Lim's self-care holidays start. First stop:Eun Skin Clinicin the affluent Cheongdam neighbourhood, south of the Han River.\n\"They do incredible lasers, the best I've experienced,\" says Lim. \"They speak really good English there, which is a big make or break for me because I'm not fluent in Korean. And because [the doctor] deals with a lot of English-speaking people, I think she realises that a lot of them are here to explore and have fun, so she doesn't want to be so aggressive with their face. They do a very customised approach.\"\nKorean skin lasers, notes Lim, are so gentle they can even be layered on top of each other to compound their transformative effects.\n\"It's very, very gentle,\" says Lim of her most recent visit. \"I did something calledRubytoning; helps with even skin tone and brightening. And there's another laser that I did calledMeDioStar®, which is brightening and tightening. And then on top of that, I didPRP[platelet-rich plasma treatment]. And then I also didmicroneedlingand thensalmon DNA. It takes maybe an hour and a half to do.\"\nShe cautions:  \"The next day, if you get five to eight treatments, your skin will be slightly bruised, but it goes away within, I would say, 48 hours. [These lasers are] effective on the deeper surface level, but on the topical level, you can't really tell that you've gotten anything done… But then after I went home, and people were like, 'Wait, did you, did you do something to your face? ' And you're like, 'Okay, I think it's kicking in'.\"\nLim recommends visitors hit skin clinics at the beginning of their trip – \"first thing when they land… because these clinics like to check up on you after three-to-five days. During that downtime, you could do coffee and check out some incredible museums and do some shopping.\"\nWebsite:www.eunskin.co.kr/\nAddress: 88-37 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2 546 3322\nInstagram:@eunskinclinic/\nAs part of her downtime from skin procedures, Lim also likes to indulge in relaxing body treatments.\n\"There's this spa calledGogyeol,\" says Lim. \"I love this place to reset my body. They do a traditional Korean massage and scrub.\"\nLike Eun Skin Clinic, Spa Gogyeol is found in Cheongdam; a two-minute walk from the Gangnam-Gu Office metro station. Lim notes that Spa Gogyeol is a not ajjimjilbang(a public Korean bathhouse). \"A lot of people love Korean bathhouses [because] they do this intensive scrub where they literally scrub off all the dead cells off your skin and it just comes purging off your body. It's pretty disgusting. But [Spa Gogyeol does] that treatment in a private setting, so you can get the body scrub, the upgrade massage and a detox wrap. They literally scrub off every dead skin cell on your body, and it just feels so soft. You feel like you're floating.\"\nSpa Gogyeol also offers a rich menu of holistic medical treatments, working with the body'sfive Tae energies. \"In Korean health, a lot of it is about balance,\" says Lim. \"So they'll really analyse your body to see what they need to focus on, and they'll customise it for you.\n\"I think a lot of people that are on holiday just want to relax,\" she adds. \"A lot of tired mamas. It's a very calming space.\"\nWebsite:https://spa-gogyeol.com/\nAddress: 3F&4F, 13, Seolleung-ro 132-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea\nPhone: +82 10-7682-1297\nInstagram:@spa_gogyeol\nWhere Eun Skin Clinic is expressly high tech and Spa Gogyeol takes a holistic approach, Lim's next spa pick –Trinity Spain Seoul's Yongsan District –  is all about pampering and beautification.\n\"It's a little tricky with Trinity spa because their English isn't the best,\" says Lim. \"But I think they're working on it. They're more of a general spa; that's why I feel okay recommending it. They do everything from amazing facials, really focussing on lifting the face and focussing on your lines, and brightening and tightening to body contouring, massages. They cover it all.\"\nTrinity Spa's array of facial and body treatments toe the line between technology and relief – like the Real Jade Stone V-line jaw contour treatment or the lymphatic drainage leg massages – all administered in private guest rooms with cushy spa beds designed for ultimate relaxation.\n\"It's just a very relaxing experience for someone that wants a general spa experience,\" says Lim.\nWebsite:www.trinityspa.co.kr/\nAddress: 3rd floor, Taeseok Building 116 Dokseodang-ro, Hannam-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-420-0797\nInstagram:@the_trinityspa_official/\nThe Korean skincare craze began in the early 2010s; global cosmetic purveyor Sephora's website now features aK-beauty sectionand Lim herself often providesK-beauty product recommendationson social media.\nSo when in Korea, shop as the Koreans do.\n\"Everyone needs to go toAmorepacific World Headquarters,\" declares Lim. Known as the inventor of thecushion foundation, Amorepacific now also owns many popular Korean skincare companies includingSulwhasoo,Innisfree,CosrxandLaneige. \"It's open to the public, which a lot of people don't know,\" says Lim. \"In their lobby, you can get your face scanned; a lot of people go there to get their cushion foundation customised… they have a beauty store in their lobby, so you can experience all of their brands at once. [There's also] an interactive Amorepacific store calledAMORE Seongsu. It's in this warehouse-y cement building; it's like you're walking through a store, but with a bathroom installation in front of you while you try things. Everything is technology-driven; you can get customised lip treatments, customised foundation. I could spend hours there.\"\nLim adds: \"There's also theSulwhasoo flagship store, which is just beautiful in itself.\"\nSulwhasoo, a luxury skin line, is headquartered in Seoul's upscale shopping district Sinsa-dong, in a modular structure channelling a golden lantern. \"The shopping is great, and it looks like you're entering an installation,\" says Lim. \"It has two spas. You could have, like, a foot scrub [or] a therapist with the singing bowl around your abdomen.\"\nLim also enjoys shopping for her favourite Korean brands at Olive Young. \"It's the Sephora of Korea,\" she says. \"They're on every corner. But the key thing is to know which one to go to. There'sone in Myeongdong, which is the largest. Then thenewest one is in Seongsuand it's a lot more tech-driven.\" Apart from beauty shopping, the five-storey Olive Young in Seongsu houses a cafe and a skin and scalp clinic as well as professional makeup services and a \"trend pod\" showroom. \"Olive Young can be slightly outdated depending which one you go to,\" says Lim. \"But this one feels like the future of what Olive Young will be.\"\nWebsite:https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/our-culture/amorepacific-space/amorepacific-headquarters/amorepacific-headquarters.html(Amorepacific World Headquarters)\nAddress: 100 Hangang-daero, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-604-05114\nInstagram:@amorepacificgroup.official/\nWebsite:https://www.amoremall.com/kr/ko/store/display?storeCode=001(Amorepacific Seongsu)\nAddress: 7 Achasan-ro 11-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-469-8600\nWebsite:https://www.sulwhasoo.com/int/en/flagship/dosan/index.html(Sulwhasoo flagship)\nAddress: 18 Dosan-daero 45-gil, Sinsa-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2-541-9270\nInstagram:@sulwhasoo.official/\nWebsite:https://global.oliveyoung.com/(Olive Young Seongsu)\nAddress: 300-65 Seongsu-dong 2(i)-ga, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone:+82 2-461-5290\nInstagram:@oliveyoung_global/\nTo cap off a day of beauty, Lim heads straight for the hair salon. \"This is actually quite common in Korea,\" she says. \"After you get all your skin treatments, you go get your hair done.\"\nLim favoursABYBOM, a massive, three-storey salon on Seolleung-ro that boasts a client roster of Korean celebs likeSandara Park. \"A lot of people that go to events get the full service of hair and makeup done,\" says Lim. \"They do amazing cuts.

Then downstairs, there is a cafe calledNudake;they have conceptual coffees and baked goods.\"\nNudake Café proffers itscoffees and whimsical pastries on stark countertops, like modern art displays. \"It sounds so ridiculous, but they have these tiny, tiny, tiny, miniature croissants,\" says Lim. \"They're literally the size of your pinky nail bed, but it's so good, and it's just so fun to take a photo with. [And] they have incredible coffee. It's actually quite hard to find non-dairy milks, but they have non-dairy milk there.

    "title": "Inside the life of Old Delhi's only female pigeon keeper",
    "content": "In the male-dominated world of Delhi's kabootarbazi, one woman's passion for her birds has earned her respect, admiration – and a place in the sky.\nAs dusk descends on Old Delhi, the bustling streets grow even more crowded, with pedestrians inching forward through jam-packed streets and auto-rickshaws honking impatiently. But above the chaos, a quieter ritual takes flight. On rooftops across the old quarters,kabootarbaaz(pigeon keepers) release their cherished flocks into the sky. Whistles pierce the air and calls echo from rooftop to rooftop. And the birds respond, transforming the skyline into a swirling spectacle.\nPigeon keeping in Old Delhi is more than a pastime; it's an umbilical cord to the identity of Old Delhi that's rooted in the city's Mughal heritage. \"A kabootarbaaz takes immense pride in their pigeons,\" says Ratnendu Ray, who conducts heritage walks in Delhi for the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH). \"It's a sense of self, cultural identity and belonging.\"\nThe tradition of pigeon keeping, known askabootarbazi,dates to ancient times, tracing its roots to the era of theMahabharata(between 400BC and AD200) when the birds were kept in palaces to entertain royalty. \"Women of the court would often sit in theirjharokhas(balconies) and watch the pigeons in flight,\" says author and historian Rana Safvi.\nHowever, she explains, it was under the Muslim rulers that this pastime evolved into a popular sport.\n\"The sport reached its zenith under Emperor Jahangir, who likened kabutarbaazi toishqbaazi(the art of love) and brought expert pigeon trainers to Delhi, elevating the tradition to a new level of refinement.\"\nThousands of pigeon keepers across the city carry on this tradition, rising through the ranks fromshagird, or trainee, eventually rising to be akhalifa. \"[They are] finally recognised by the fraternity as anustaad– the highest level one can attain,\" says Ray.\nWhile kabootarbazi is traditionally a man's job passed down from father to son over the centuries, Shaheen Parveen has the distinction of being the only female pigeon keeper in Delhi.\nIn the neighbourhood of Khawaja Mir Dard Basti, Parveen transitions through various roles in a day, from devoted wife to mother to grandmother. However, as soon as she is alone, she climbs up the bamboo stairs that lead to the rooftop of her house, high above the crammed lanes where men savour kebabs frying in small eateries.\nShe starts her day inspecting her more than 100 pigeons, ensuring that each one is healthy before feeding them a custom grain mix. She then trains them through timed flights, using whistles or claps for recall. Evenings involve roll calls and nest checks; she also perfects their skills for competitions.\nAt sunset, Parveen's voice stands out from the myriad calls of men echoing for pigeons. As she raises her voice to the highest pitch, people peer out of their windows and from their terraces to catch a glimpse of their favourite pigeon keeper.\nBeing a kabootarbaaz is both tradition and passion, and Parveen says that spending time with the birds brings her a sense of peace and tranquillity. \"If I don't spend time with them, I feel sick; they are like my children,\" she says.\nParveen's rise to the respected status she now holds within the male-dominated community has been far from easy.\nShe credits her father for her love of the sport. \"Every day after returning from school, he would take me to the rooftop to see his pigeons and that is when my love for the birds began,\" she says. However, she had to contend with the disapproval of her brother, who forbade her from pursuing the hobby. Later, she faced criticism from others who claimed it was unbecoming for a woman.\nHowever, she persisted, driven by her love for the birds. \"When your skills are praised and the community respects you for them, you feel uplifted, then the voices of those who speak against you don't matter,\" she says. \"Let people say whatever they want to, I will continue doing what I want and what gives me peace.\"\nParveen has earned widespread respect across the community for her talents. \"People see the visit of an experienced pigeon keeper to their roofs as a blessing; I receive many offers from people requesting me to bless their pigeons,\" she says with a smile. However, she usually declines these offers: \"I don't get time from my own pigeons; also it is tiring.\"\nExperienced pigeon keepers like Mohsin Ustaad take out time from their busy schedules to support Parveen with feed and medicine, expenses that she sometimes struggles to afford. \"I came to her terrace because I respect her and have admiration for her skill,\" says Mohsin. Parveen smiles shyly: \"It costs thousands of rupees – thankfully Mohsin helps us.\"\nParveen's biggest triumph came when her pigeons won a major local race that drew hundreds of ustaads and hobbyists from Old Delhi and beyond – many of whom had trained their birds for months or years in preparation. In the race, the pigeons were released from a remote location and had to find their way back home. Judging was based on speed, endurance and how well the pigeons responded to their ustaad's calls.\nMore like this:\n•Thirteen photos that will make you care about the ocean\n•A 58-tunnel slow train through India's Eastern Ghats\n•Witnessing the synchronised dance of a million starlings in Denmark\nRace winners are awarded trophies, cash prizes and immense respect within the kabootarbazi community. Afterwards, scores of pigeon keepers presented Parveen with gifts. \"Some even gave me money. It was like India had won the World Cup, some put garlands on me, I was nervous and happy,\" she says, showing videos and pictures of the event.\n\"People recognised her, she got more respect,\" her daughter adds.\nPigeon keeping has also become an attraction for travellers visiting Delhi, who are intrigued to see a way of life they may have seen in Bollywood movies but never witnessed for themselves.\nKabootarbaazi, Ray says, is governed by a rich set of social structures, unspoken rules and codes of conduct. \"Pigeon-keepers often operate within specific territories, usually based around their neighbourhood or rooftop,\" he explains. \"Venturing into territory of others is seen as disrespectful. There are also competitions and tournaments; witnessing all of it is a traveller's delight.\"\nHis heritage walkPrayer, power and pigeon: A heritage walk and kabootarbazintroduces visitors to this world, walking through the winding alleys between houses and watching the birds soaring through the open city skies.\nContent creators are also flocking to Old Delhi to capture the sight of the birds soaring and swirling in the sky. As they climb up to the terraces, seasoned pigeon keepers spring into action. They tighten their grip on the mesh used to guide the birds mid-flight with swift, practiced motions; they whistle, clap and call out in rhythmic chants.\nThe pigeons, mid-flight, respond in unison, veering back toward home, their wings slicing through the air in a synchronised dance. \"I've been following pages of pigeon keepers on YouTube and other platforms for some time now,\" says Imran Ahmed, who came to take photos for his social media platforms. \"Today, I'm glad to finally be among them, capturing photos and being photographed alongside these beautiful birds.\"\nAs the day ends, Parveen climbs to her terrace and lets her birds out. When they reach a certain height, she calls them to return. They respond right away. \"I train each bird to recognise my voice, to know my call and trust me. It's a bond that you can't build overnight,\" Parveen explains, adjusting her pigeons' feed.\nThough not an official ustaad yet, her skill and status are undeniable. \"These birds feel my moods, and I feel theirs,\" she says, smiling. \"In this world of feathers and sky, they know me as I know them. That's something no one can take from me.\" "

    "title": "The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'",
    "content": "You can’t book them and you don't know who else will be there, but they're an excellent way to explore Britain's most remote corners – for free.\nHiking up to the top of a valley in Wales'Cambrian Mountains, I was struck by the silence. The noise of the modern world that we've trained ourselves to filter out becomes conspicuous by its absence. This is probably the best indication that you've entered one of Britain's remote places, and a good sign if you're trying to find a bothy, one of the free-to-use shelters that dot the country's wild areas.\nFounded in 1965, theMountain Bothy Association (MBA)is a registered charity that maintains \"simple shelters in remote country for the use of all who love wild and lonely places\". The organisation manages more than 100 bothies in Scotland, Wales and Northern England.\nThe system is simple. Bothies are free to use and open to anyone. They can't be booked in advance, and there's an unwritten rule that the bothy is never full (although groups of six or more and commercial groups are asked not to use them). As long as you follow the MBA'sBothy Code, which is based on respect for other users, the bothy and the surroundings, you're welcome.\nThat is if you can find them. Although the grid references are availableonline, don't count on phone signal when looking for them, and even with a well-marked map, they can prove elusive.\nI was hiking a network of trails in an area known as the \"Green Desert of Wales\" because of its lack of settlements, roads and infrastructure. I planned to sleep atNant Syddion bothybefore heading to Aberystwyth, the largest nearby town, the next day. Given the relative scarcity of buildings in the landscape, I'd expected to locate the bothy easily. But climbing up and down a succession of forestry tracks as the sun began to set, I began to wonder if I was going to find it at all.\nWith relief, I finally caught the reflection of a window through the trees and climbed down a steep path to a two-storey stone building that looked like a home transported into the middle of nowhere, complete with a spiral of smoke climbing out of the chimney. And that's exactly what it was. Nant Syddion used to be home to a lead miner and his family and now provides a temporary home for hikers.\nEvery bothy is an adapted building with a previous life. Most are old shepherd's huts, farmsteads or workers' accommodation. In the early 20th Century, hill farming declined and fewer and fewer people lived in remote locations, leaving many buildings derelict. After World War Two, hiking and mountaineering as leisure pursuits dramatically increased in popularity and those exploring the outdoors began using these abandoned buildings as shelters. The MBA was created by Bernard Heath and a group of friends to restore and maintain them for like-minded individuals.\nRemote upland country takes its toll on buildings; the wind and rain age, erode and wear almost everything. However, arriving at the bothy, I found that everything was watertight and functional. Even the gate and the front door had recently been painted.\nKeeping 100 buildings habitable in some of the remotest parts of Britain is no mean feat. When you factor in that this work is all done by volunteers (and where bothies have toilets, it involves carrying the waste out), it's a step beyond altruism. Each bothy has two maintenance organisers, and work parties are organised for any large-scale or structural jobs, which, Neil Stewart, head of communications at the MBA, told me, are rarely lacking in willing hands.\nAlthough they're maintained, bothies are by no means luxurious. You won't find electricity or running water and will be lucky to have a long-drop toilet. Most will have a stove, but there's no guarantee a supply of fuel will be there. Your comforts are carried in, and you should pack as if you're camping, including a tent if the bothy is overcrowded or you don't fancy the company.\nThe company you find in bothies, and the fact that it's completely unpredictable, is one of their unique attractions, according to Phoebe Smith, authorThe Book of the Bothy. \"In a world where everything is bookable and controllable, I love that you can't do that with a bothy,\" she said. \"You just have to go and turn up, and you could have it all to yourself or you could meet some incredible people and share some incredible memories. [Bothies] connect you with other people.\"\nWhen I arrived at Nant Syddion, there were already two cyclists in the main room who were doing an off-road tour of the area. I laid out my roll mat and sleeping bag in the last unoccupied upstairs room and went to join them.\nAfter introducing myself to the cyclists, Alex and Simon, I prepared a quick meal over my gas stove while they battled to get the fire to take. Built to withstand its exposed position, the bothy had thick walls and small windows, so when the light began to disappear, it got dark quickly. We lit a succession of candles and arranged our chairs in a semicircle around the roaring fire.\nOne of the best parts of bothying for me is that people are drawn to socialise together – although you're under no obligation if you want your own space. As we warmed up by the fire, one, then two bottles of whisky (something of a traditional drink for bothies) did the round and stories began to flow. We talked about recent hiking trips in the Dolomites and our bothy experiences, arriving at one to find it full of ex-soldiers in the middle of a reunion drinking session. Hours passed and laughter continued until we remembered we had to hike and cycle back out the next day, and reluctantly left the warmth of the main room to sleep.\nA feature of every bothy is the bothy book, where people record their experiences and motivations for visiting. The next morning, I read through accounts ranging from people sheltering from the rain to alleged supernatural happenings. There was an entry roughly every couple of days, indicating a steady flow of people passing through.\nHowever, it's only been in the last decade and a half that bothies have shifted away from being something of a closed society. In 2009, the locations of the MBA bothies were shared online by the organisation. \"It used to be quite a secretive organisation in the sense that people found out where the bothies were by joining the association or just coming across them in the wilderness areas,\" Stewart explained. \"But that was unsustainable with the internet and people using the outdoors. And it was against our charitable aim. If we're providing buildings for people to use, it's logical we have to tell them where they are, we can't leave them secret.\"\nThis move wasn't unanimously popular. Part of the concern was that the people might begin using these spaces as places to party as opposed to a shelter while enjoying outdoor pursuits. But, as Stewart told me, it's not a problem that's unique to bothies. \"We have had examples of drinking parties in bothies, but we're not particularly bothered with that… There are problems with wild camping in many areas of the country. Up in Scotland, there's a ban on wild camping in one of the national parks because people were littering, leaving rubbish [and] cutting down trees for fires.\"\nMore like this:\n•Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n•The US homes made from waste materials\n•Norway's simple answer to greener, cleaner living\nThe MBA has no way of accurately recording visitor numbers, but anecdotal evidence from their maintenance teams suggests their use has increased with the greater availability of information around them. Smith said, \"There's a whole debate to be had, but the fact of the matter was that bothy users and volunteers, who were fixing them and repairing them, were ageing out and we need younger people coming in.\"\nWhile the locations of the MBA bothies are no longer a mystery, these aren't the only bothies that exist in the UK. There are others, maintained by estates or climbing clubs, where the old system of secrecy endures. As well as the adventure of seeking out hidden bothies whose locations still can't be found online, every bothy experience is unique. With a constantly changing cast of people seeking shelter, the sheer unpredictability is a rare chance in the modern world to embrace serendipity, and that's what inspires me to continue seeking them out.\nHiking out the next morning, I stopped at the bend in the track behind which the bothy would be lost in the trees. It would remain open the next night and the next, for anyone needing shelter, and I thought about all the stories and experiences I'd read through in the bothy book. The MBA network continues to grow and develop. Compostable toilets are being added to more sites, and Stewart shared that two new bothies are currently in the pipeline. That means plenty more stories to come. "

    "title": "Inside the fortress that inspired Hamlet",
    "content": "As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.\nThere's a cold wind blowing from the Øresund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsingør, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.\nThis windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April);Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take inRupert Goold's productionstarring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2016.\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" – the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure – it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsingør – the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg – but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon – and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer – as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer,special toursinvite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father – but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto – written very early in 1603 – is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsingør.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director ofHamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town'sShakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatreSchaubüneand a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n•Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n•Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n•Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists – but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry – starring a youngClaes Bangas Rosenkrantz – and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed byThe Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said thatevery minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away. "

    "content": "Oracle Red Bull Racing's driver Yuki Tsunoda talks us through the must-see places in Tokyo ahead of his home race at the Japanese Grand Prix.\nWheneverYuki Tsunodareturns to fast and furious Tokyo after months of (literally) racing around the globe, it's the city's bountiful food options that help remind him he's home.\n\"When I'm back I always make a detailed plan of where I'm going to eat,\" declares the young Red Bull driver; known for being one of Formula 1's biggestfoodies. \"On every single street and every single block there are so many great restaurants. The competition for food is so high as currently Tokyo has thehighest concentration of Michelin star restaurants in the world.\nA native of Sagamihara city, around 47km south-west of Tokyo, Tsunoda – who now lives in Milan, Italy – heads straight to Tokyo whenever he's back in Japan.  \"Even when I return to Japan now, which happens around three times a year, I normally stay in Tokyo,\" he says. \"That's where I can do business, enjoy the food and experience the nightlife. It's always so fun to be back there.\"\nEach April, Tsunoda's return to Tokyo is particularly triumphant when he races in his home Grand Prix. For Tsunoda, what separates the Japanese Grand Prix from the other tracks is the scintillating and contagious atmosphere, which he insists he \"can feel in the car\". Every time Tsunoda emerges at the Suzuka Circuit, he's greeted with a tidal wave of cheers and support that only increases when he's in the car and racing around the circuit.\nThe excitement was particularly vibrant at the2024 Japanese Grand Prix, when he finished 10th to become the first Japanese drive to score points since 2012. \"As soon as I got out of the car, I could see so many people were happy,\" he says. \"With that kind of support, you just feel like a hero. You also feel extra pressure too, and responsibility. But it's a special feeling.\"\nAfter the race, Tsunoda had no shortage of ways to celebrate. As the world's most populous metropolitan area, home to more than 41 million residents as of 2024, Tokyo is constantly abuzz with energy and excitement. Visitors (and locals) get lost in its bustling markets and bask in its futuristic, neon-lit shopping and nightlife sectors, while the city's many parks, gardens and ancient temples mean there's also room for contemplation and self-reflection.\nHere are Tsunoda's top ways to enjoy Tokyo – off the grid.\nThe city now known as Tokyo began life as asmall fishing village called Edo, inhabited since ancient times. Today, its centuries of rich history are proudly on display in its captivating backdrop of modern skyscrapers set against historic temples. Each of the city's 23 wards offers unique sights – like youthful, trendy Shibuya with its iconic \"scramble\" street crossing; and Ginza, lined with elegant luxury boutiques.\nWhen Tsunoda wants to soak up Tokyo's modern-meets-ancient scenery, he heads toAsakusa, a serene neighbourhood known for its traditional charm and for being one of Tokyo's main geisha districts. \"If you want to see the traditional side in Japan, theSensō-ji templeis so nice,\" says Tsunoda. Known for its majestic Hozomon Gate, Sensō-ji is the oldest temple in Tokyo; a five-storey pagoda and Buddhist place of worship that instantly transports you to 7th-Century Japan. Visitors to Asakusa can also stroll down Nakamise-dori; one of Japan's oldest shopping streets.\nAnd for a mile-high view of the city, Tsunoda suggests visitingTokyo Skytree. The tallest freestanding tower in the world at 634m, Tokyo Skytree offers stunning, all-encompassing views of Tokyo and beyond. \"It's the highest building in Tokyo and you can see the whole city from there,\" says Tsunoda. Visitors can also enjoy the mammoth tower's 300-plus shops and restaurants.

Helmed by Hiroshi Kouga – who has been making soba for more than 20 years – the elegant space remains one of Tokyo's most affordable Michelin-starred soba noodle shops.\nTsunoda also insists that visitors try wagyu steak when they're in Tokyo. Translating to \"Japanese cow\", wagyu is globally regarded as premium beef for its flavour and tenderness, made rich and juicy by the distinctive marbling pattern of fat. Tsunoda insists, \"Wagyu just tastes different when it's from a cow fed in Japan.\"\nTsunoda's favourite place to enjoy wagyu steak isUkai-Teiin the upscale Ginza district, lauded for its opulent mixture of Art Noveau and Japanese design. Watching its chefs prepare dishes on a teppan grill adds to the entertainment factor.\nWebsite:\nhttps://osobanokouga.com/\nAddress: 2-14-5 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106-0031\nPhone Number: +81 3-3797-6860\nSeafood is a staple in Japanese cuisine, taking the starring role in dishes from traditional breakfasts of grilled fish and rice to delicious, rainbow-coloured sushi.\nFor the best fish in town, Tsunoda heads toTsukiji Outer Market, locally known as Japan's \"Food Town\". Located next to the historicTsukiji Marketwhere the city's famous tuna auctions were held for decades, the lively market is crammed with stalls selling the freshest seafood. Some of the city's most famous restaurants come here to get their fish, but the market is also packed to the brim with hole-in-the-wall spots where you can snack on some of Japan's most famous foods, liketamagoyaki(omelette on a stick),mochi(glutinous rice cake) and wagyu beef skewers. It's also where Tsunoda says you can find some of Tokyo's best sushi.\n\"There are many sushi restaurants at Tsukiji Outer Market,\" he says. \"And since it is a fish market, the fish is very fresh, especially in the morning when you can enjoy it right there… It's just really great to watch people, walk around the fish market and soak up the atmosphere.\"\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/\nAddress: 104-0045 Tokyo, Chuo City, Tsukiji\nPhone number: +81 3-3541-9444\nInstagram:\n@tsukijicity\n\nWith scores of luxury and indie boutiques, Tokyo is a shopper's paradise – and there are a variety of areas that cater to Tsunoda's eclectic tastes. \"I go toHarajukuwhen I want more street-style fashion that younger people wear. There's a lot there,\" he says. Located just east of Shibuya, Harajuku – known as Japan's top fashion district – is full of colourful street art, while its mass of clothing and cosplay stores, hip bars and alluring dessert shops means it's constantly buzzing with youthful vigour.\nTsunoda's first port of call in Harajuku isGR8, which is home to many of the city's up and coming designers, selling popular clothes and footwear from the US and Europe. Its neon interior and wooden entrance makes it one of the most distinct shops in the city, too. But if Tsunoda is after vintage fashion, he heads to theShimokitazawaneighbourhood, regarded as one of Tokyo's most bohemian areas, full of music venues, cafes and clothing stores. \"That's where you'll find more casual stuff,\" he says. When in Shimokitazawa, Tsunoda shops atBABEstore, a used and vintage clothing shop where you can easily spend hours looking for lost gems amidst its mass of items.\nFor luxury clothes shopping, Tsunoda suggests the very fashionableOmotesandodistrict, sometimes referred to as the Champs-Elysees of the city. \"That's where you get the brand stuff,\" he says. \"The items that are higher in price and where the most famous brands are.\"\nTsunoda likes jumping from store to store in the Tadao Ando-designedOmotesando Hillsshopping complex.

    "title": "'It was born to be a champion': How Dubai chocolate conquered the world",
    "content": "Invented to satiate pregnancy cravings, Dubai chocolate is a rare combination of creativity, flavours and social media success that has broken all industry records.\nIt was a cold, damp evening in Munich in December 2024, but the festive tunes and the twinkling fairy lights at the MarienplatzChristkindlmarkt(Christmas market) lifted my spirits. With a mug ofglühwein(hot mulled wine) in hand, I made my way to the candy stall to get my usual supply of German Christmas cookies. But I stopped in my tracks when I realised that the longest queue was not forlebkuchen(gingerbread biscuits baked for Christmas) or the traditional stollen fruit bread, but for a new kid on the block: Dubai chocolate.\nThat was my first encounter with the viral chocolate in a land far from its birthplace. But by then, Dubai chocolate had already become a global sensation: a rich, sticky and unapologetically extra chocolate bar that hadshattered industry records, won millions of hearts and wasspreading like wildfireacross the world.\nA decadent milk chocolate bar filled with silky pistachio cream, earthy tahini and crunchy shards of knafeh pastry, the original Dubai chocolate was launched by Dubai-basedFIX Dessert Chocolatierin 2022 when its British Egyptian founder, Sarah Hamouda, had an urge to create something unique to satisfy her pregnancy cravings for knafeh and pistachio. FIX called their creation \"Can't Get Knafeh Of It\".\nCan't Get Knafeh Of It took the world by storm when TikTok influencer Maria Vehera posted arapturous videoof herself trying the chocolate bar inside her car in December 2023. The video quickly went viral, attracting more than 125 million views and scores of fans around the world who were willing to do anything to grab a bite. The bar became a craze and was promptly christened \"Dubai chocolate\".\nIn aninterviewwith the BBC earlier this year, Yezen Alani, co-founder of FIX, described the international spotlight as \"flattering and humbling\". However, despite FIX's plans for global expansion, its Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar remains solely available in the UAE, pushing independent chocolatiers and multinational brands such asLindtandÜlkerto mimic the original and produce their own versions to meet global demand. These imitations, also known as \"Dubai chocolate\", have inundated supermarkets and neighbourhood bodegas all over the world.\nToday, Dubai chocolate can be found everywhere, from the online shelves of UAE's food delivery apps and the brimming counters of Istanbul's sweet shops to the packed aisles of London's Lidl stores and the chaotic alleyways of Mumbai's flea markets. Global demand continues to skyrocket, resulting inworldwide stockoutsand aninternational pistachio shortage. It has spawned waitlists at chocolate counters across Europe and the United States and inspired limited-edition collaborations with major brands likeShake ShackandStarbucks. Supermarkets have begunrationing Dubai chocolate,and people have beencaught smugglingthe prized bars. In short, the Dubai chocolate craze has shaken the global chocolate industry.\nThis has opened up a whole new market for artisan confectioners worldwide, including the renownedMaison Samadiin London. Maison Samadi, a UK chocolatier with roots in Lebanon dating to 1872, was the first to introduce their version of the viral Dubai chocolate bars, named \"Dubai Viral Style Chocolate\" in London. For Nabil Chehab, business development director at Maison Samadi, making Dubai Viral Style Chocolate was a natural segue in their chocolate-making journey. \"We were already working on our heritage collection when we discovered the viral Dubai chocolate. It fitted perfectly because it combined a beloved Middle Eastern dessert, the knafeh, which was a tribute to the Samadi family heritage, with chocolate, our core expertise,\" says Chehab.\nChehab tells me that the demand for their Dubai Viral Style Chocolate bars has far exceeded their expectations, likely due to the interesting concept behind it. \"It's remarkable how the FIX team came up with this innovative idea of having a'dessert in a chocolate bar'that has now become more enjoyable and satisfying than just a regular chocolate bar,\" enthuses Chehab. For centuries, food lovers have relished knafeh on its own. Now, Dubai chocolate allows them to sample this well-known dessert inside a chocolate shell, making the experience even more intriguing and exciting.\n\"The real success of Dubai chocolate stems from its texture,\" agrees leading Turkish food writerAylin Öney Tan. \"The velvety gooeyness of the pistachio cream doesn't just feel good on your palate; it is also visually attractive. Additionally, the crunchy texture of thekadayifpastry from the knafeh makes the dessert even more irresistible.\"\n\"Chocolates with a palpable crunch, such as Swiss Toblerone and Ferrero Rocher, have always done well in the market,\" explains Öney Tan. \"Same with Dubai chocolate. Only in this case, the crunch goes an extra mile and primes the chocolate bar for social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\" As Vehera bites into the paint-splattered chocolate bar in her TikTok video, decadent pistachio cream oozes out and crunchyASMR(autonomous sensory meridian response) sounds fill the foreground, making it a clear social media winner.\nHowever, \"although Dubai chocolate's instant growth has been fuelled largely by social media, the exclusivity of the original bar has kept the interest going,\" says Monique Naval, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International. The original Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar is only available online at 14:00 and 17:00 through online food delivery appDeliverooin the UAE. FIX produces around 500 bars every day, and they sell out fast. The limited availability, both temporal and geographical, creates afear of missing out, further increasing interest and demand.\n\"Having Dubai in the name also adds to the chocolate's popularity and hype,\" says Naval. When people think of Dubai, they think of lavish hotels, glitzy malls, luxurious cars and gold-dusted desserts. Similar \"feelings of indulgence drive the success of Dubai chocolate,\" she adds.\nBeyond its viral fame, Dubai chocolate's resonance also lies in its deep Middle Eastern roots – tapping into family traditions of sharing sweets, gifting edible treats and the nostalgic flavours of knafeh and pistachios woven into daily life across the region.\nFor Chehab, the connection runs deep.\n\"When my wife's great-grandfather, Muhieddine Samadi, started Al Samadi Sweets in Beirut in 1872, knafeh was one of the first sweets he ever sold,\" he reminisces. \"I grew up in Beirut. As a kid, I remember taking the famous Lebanese shared taxi to Al Samadi Sweets daily, picking up a plate of knafeh for breakfast and eating it on my way to my father's shop. Little did I know [at that time] that I would be marrying Samadi's lovely great-granddaughter,\" he adds, with a twinkle in his eyes.\nIn an interview withArabian Businesslast year, Hamouda said, \"I wanted the FIX experience to be different. I wanted people, from that first bite, to relive moments of their past.\" And for many fans around the world, that first bite delivers exactly what Hamouda intended: an edible journey back to bustling Middle Eastern souks, where merchants sell delicious local sweets and the air is dense with the aroma of pistachios.\nMore like this:\n•The baffling purple honey found only in North Carolina\n•The world's true cradle of chocolate\n•A beauty mogul's guide to luxury self-care in Dubai\n\"Sixty-eight percent of the world's consumers want to experience cultures other than their own and that includes a willingness and desire to try new flavours and ingredients,\" explains Naval. Pistachios – a Middle Eastern staple – are riding this wave too, billed as thenext big seasonal flavour globally, and appearing in everything from lattes to liqueurs.\nAt the same time,Middle Eastern tourism is boomingand Dubai has emerged as a culinary destination in its own right, with some visitorsflying injust to taste the viral chocolate firsthand. What began as a simple chocolate bar in a Dubai dessert shop has evolved into a global sensation.\n\"I am not surprised,\" says Chehab, reflecting on the chocolate's meteoric rise. \"It is the perfect amalgamation of taste, texture, indulgence and nostalgia. It was born to be a champion.\" \n"

    "title": "The great conclave secret: What do would-be popes eat?",
    "content": "For more than 750 years, strict rules have guarded what cardinals can and cannot eat to prevent hidden messages stuffed inside chicken, ravioli and napkins.\nThis past week, travellers in Rome may have spotted cardinals frequenting their favourite restaurants. Just before thelast papal election in 2013, Italian media reported that many of these men were making the time to visit a particular neighbourhood favourite,Al Passetto di Borgo, a family-run eatery located 200m from Saint Peter's Basilica, where Cardinal Donald William Wuerl is known to order the lasagna and Francesco Coccopalmerio (allegedly themost-voted Italian cardinalin 2013) likes the grilled squid.\nCardinals may feel some urgency to get in a good meal or two because, during theconclavebeginning on 7 May, in which 135 cardinals will hold a secret election for a new pope in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, they'll be entirely secluded from the rest of the world for an indefinite period of time. Voting, sleeping and eating all take place in tightly controlled sequestration.\nPapal conclaves are notoriously secretive affairs. The cardinals are secured in a single shared space with no messages allowed in or out, except for the smoke signalling whether a vote has been successful. White smoke signals a new pope and black means another vote is required to reach the two-thirds-plus-one consensus required to crown a new pontiff. What precisely occurs in these conclaves is unknown, but one thing is certain: the cardinals must eat over the days or weeks it takes to elect the new leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.\nBut with provisions going in and out, how is the secrecy of the conclave maintained? How can the cardinals ensure the integrity of the vote, unaffected by outside opinion?\nHistorically, food has presented a potential risk: a cardinal's ravioli might be stuffed with an illicit message from the kitchen staff; or a cardinal could sneak a vote update to the outside world with a dirty napkin. However, communal eating is also one of the contexts in which furtive negotiations can take place. Recent pop culture representations have made the most of this, using conclave food culture to create a heightened sense of suspicion, intrigue and control.\nTake the 2024 filmConclave, where almost all the plot points occur not in the voting chambers, but in the cafeteria. The noisy meals contrast with the almost entirely silent conclave proper, which proceeds without formal debates. The otherwise silent voting is only sparingly punctuated by moments of ritual speech, like the audible oath a cardinal takes as he drops his voting card into the ballot urn. Still, around the ceremonial silence is a great deal of communication, much of which happens with and via food. And while we can't assume that the film faithfully depicts what happens behind closed doors, it is no doubt true that in papal food culture – as in culture more broadly – what you eat, how you eat and with whom you eat speaks volumes.\nThe code of conclave secrecy goes back to 1274, when Pope Gregory X established the regulations that still partly dictate how papal elections are run today. As with the coronation of many popes, his was controversial. It also had the distinction of being by far the longest, taking almost three years (1268-1271) to reach the majority consensus required to appoint a new pope. According to Italian canonist Henricus de Segusio, who served in that conclave, local residents threatened to restrict the cardinals' food to hasten a resolution.\nPope Gregory X's new rules included isolation of the conclave – a rule that is still in effect today – and rationing of the cardinals' food. After three days without consensus, the cardinals received only one daily meal; after eight days, only bread and water. In the mid-1300s, these rules were relaxed by Clement VI, who permitted three-course meals consisting of soup; a main dish of fish, meat or eggs; and dessert, which could include cheese or fruit. While the rationing didn't stick, tight control over conclaves remains.\nThe most detailed historical account of the food culture of papal conclaves comes fromBartolomeo Scappi, who was the Renaissance's most famous chef (and arguably the world's first celebrity chef) and served both Popes Pius IV and Pius V. His 1570 book,Opera Dell'Arte del Cucinare(The Art of Cooking) – the first cookbook published by a practicing chef – catapulted him to fame. In it, he reveals the secrets of feeding the conclave that elected Pope Julius III, and the extreme practice of surveillance that remains to this day.\nMore like this:\n•Testaccio: The foodie neighbourhood where Romans go to eat\n•Where Rome's insider foodie Katie Parla queen eats in her hometown\n•An Italian cultural ambassador's guide to Rome\nAccording to Scappi, the cardinals' daily meals were prepared in a communal kitchen by cooks and sommeliers, just two of the many domestic positions that kept a conclave functioning. He identifies that the kitchen was a space where illicit messages could be shared, and notes that guards were stationed there specifically to prevent this. Therefore, twice a day in an order determined by lottery, stewards would ceremoniously bring the food to theruota. This \"wheel\" or turntable, built into the wall, allowed food and drink to be passed to the cardinals in their inner hall. Before being passed through the wall, food and drinks were checked by testers to ensure they were not hiding any illicit messages. Every step was closely watched by Italian and Swiss guards.\nThe foodstuffs were strictly controlled, with nothing permitted that might obscure a secret message. No closed pies. No whole chickens. Wine and water had to be offered in clear glass, not in opaque vessels. Cloth napkins were opened and carefully inspected.\nThis arrangement was partly to ensure the complete isolation of the cardinals, and partly to assuage concerns about poisoning. After all, especially during the Renaissance, the papacy was a highly influential political position.\nStrict protocol and food restrictions aside, the meals Scappi describes sound bountiful and balanced, including salad, fruit, charcuterie, wine and fresh water. Likewise, he describes comfortable accommodations for the cardinals. Each had their own large cell, decorated with silk and amply furnished with a bed, a table, a clothing rack, two stools, a chamber pot and a lockable jar, among many other items. By Scappi's account, serving in a Renaissance papal conclave wasn't a bad gig – so long as you didn't mind constant surveillance.\nFor the upcoming conclave starting on 7 May, the nuns at theDomus Sanctae Marthae– the modern residence where cardinals live during their sequestration – will prepare simple dishes characteristic of Lazio, the Italian region surrounding the Vatican, and nearby Abruzzo: minestrone, spaghetti,arrosticini(lamb skewers) and boiled vegetables. While this may seem to differ from Renaissance conclaves where meals were prepared by secular domestics operating under strict protocol and close guard, the result is the same: the process is closely controlled, ensuring no information can get in or out.\nIn the first of several kitchen scenes that appear in Conclave, the film makes a point of showing nuns boiling whole chickens for broth – hardly luxurious fare. But it's the symbolism that's important. The modern Catholic church – especially coming out of the leadership of Pope Francis – hopes to communicate a simple, wholesome image. Concerns about the potential for food (whole chickens, specifically) to contain literal secret messages have faded. It's illicit communication through electronic means, another recurring symbol in the film, that's the concern now.\nSo, while the Vatican is being swept for hidden electronic devices in preparation for the upcoming conclave, the cardinals will do their own personal preparations, venturing into Rome to linger over a favourite dish or two, perhaps wondering whether it will be their last supper before becoming pope.

    "title": "8 ways to travel more sustainably in 2025",
    "content": "You're ready to book your next holiday, and you're aware of the importance of minimising your travel footprint. But where do you begin?\nIf you're stumped, you're not alone. A new Booking.comreportfound sustainability is important to 84% of global travellers. But while the desire to travel greener is strong, the path to eco-tourism is unclear for many. A Trip.comstudyfound that nearly half of travellers are confused about what sustainable travel actually means, while a 2025 World Travel & Tourism Councilreportrevealed that cost is a major barrier.\nWith global tourism bouncing back and environmental pressures intensifying, 2025 is a crucial year to rethink how we travel. Here are some simple, practical ways to make more impactful travel choices this year – without sacrificing joy or comfort on the road.\nAs you plan your holidays for 2025 and beyond, experts recommend asking yourself whether you want to be a passive tourist or a visitor who makes a positive impact on the destination. A regenerative-focused trip could involve hands-on conservation at anEcuadorian ecolodgeor choosing an Australianhiking experiencehelping to revive Aboriginal culture. Fiji's new Loloma Hour encourages travellers to dedicate at least one hour of their stay to a positive environmental, cultural or social impact activity, while Hawaii'sMālama experiencesencourage visitors to give back to the environment and local communities through habitat restoration, beach cleanups and more.\n\"We must do better than just sustain travel,\" said David Leventhal, eco-hotel owner and co-founder ofRegenerative Travel, a leading provider of educational courses aimed at transforming the travel industry into a force for positive change. \"We must reverse damage, and regenerate working at a whole systems level to integrate people and planet better.\"\nIn 2025, travellers are increasingly aware of the social and cultural impacts of tourism, with Booking.com's 2025 Travel & Sustainability Report showing for the first time that more than half of global travellers are aware of tourism's impact on local communities as well as the environment. With overtourism protests – which are already ramping up in 2025 – and unaffordable housing in popular destinations, there's a growing call to be more mindful about how, when and where we travel.\n\"That's not to say that the environmental elements of sustainable travel are less important – reducing carbon emissions and plastic are as important as ever,\" says Dr Susanne Becken, professor of sustainable tourism at Australia's Griffith University, \"but the growth of tourism is putting more and more pressure on communities to a point where some tourism hotspots don't want to engage with it anymore.\"\nSteering clear of popular destinations at peak times, being more respectful of local cultures and people, hiring local and Indigenous guides and purchasing more mindfully – from accommodation tosouvenirs– can all help to reduce pressure on communities. \"Remember that the destination you are visiting is someone's home,\" says Becken.\nLooking for immersive, community-based travel? Nepal's Community Homestay Network has launched three new \"community circuits\" for 2025, including an itinerary traversing little-visited eastern Nepal; while anew Intrepid Travel tripoffers an opportunity to engage with Indigenous elders on a journey to Colombia's \"Lost City\". Fromvisiting a Thai island that has taken sustainability into its own handsto experiencing life in agroundbreaking Swedish town, there are now countless opportunities to visit communities in responsible and regenerative ways.\nHotels and other holiday accommodations contribute alarge proportionof the CO2 emitted by the tourism sector – but better options are emerging. The world's first carbon-positive hotel,Populus, opened in the US in 2024; and IHG launched its first branded net-zero hotel in the UK in March 2025,voco Zeal Exeter Science Park.\nIn South Africa, Few & Far Luvhondo, which opened in January 2025, is among anincreasingnumber of safari lodges prioritising sustainable innovation and eco-tourism. This zero-waste, renewable energy-powered lodge is working to rewild 50,000 hectares of highly degraded land in the Soutpansberg mountains – and even has Africa's first solar-powered cable-car experience.\nBut you don't need a luxury safari lodge budget to make more sustainable accommodation choices. A network of UKhiking \"hotels\"offers free, minimal-impact stays, whileEarthshipsin the US offer unique net-zero accommodation. In Europe, social impact-driven affordable accommodation providerThe Social Hubopened a new hotel in Rome in March 2025, with another due to open in Porto this year.\nBecken recommends checking for international certification (like B Corp, EarthCheck, Green Globe and Green Key), which indicate a company is committed to energy efficiency and mindful consumption, and cares about how its people are treated. In the absence of certification, which can be financially challenging for small businesses to obtain, check the property's website for a meaningful sustainability policy encompassing environmental and social initiatives, or contact them directly to ask. The same approach can be taken with tour operators.\nMany destinations are making it easier for travellers to minimise their impact when they arrive, via initiatives likezero-waste dining,electric safaris– or evendecarbonising their entire visitor economies.\nBut while destinations are getting greener, getting there often isn't. Air travel remains one of the most carbon-intensive parts of tourism, and Becken notes that \"sustainable\" aviation fuels alone cannot solve aviation's soaring emissions.\nIn good news for rail travel enthusiasts, there are a slew of new opportunities in 2025 to take a memorable – and lower-impact – route to your destination. In Australia, theIndian Pacifichas extended its journey from Perth to Sydney to five days with new off-train experiences on each leg; whileLa Dolce Vita Orient Express, Italy's first homegrown luxury train, made its inaugural journey from Rome to the Tuscan hill town of Montalcino in April. Expected to be completed in 2025, Portugal's Evora-to-Elvas route is the first link in a high-speed network that will eventually connect Madrid to Lisbon in three hours; and a renewed version of the legendaryOrient Expresscarrying passengers between Istanbul and Paris, is due to roll in 2026, along with a new Budapest-to-Belgrade line.\nWhen you do need to fly, choose low-emissions flights with the help of booking platforms like Google Flights, which displays the average emissions for each route. Booking economy seats and prioritising direct flights also reduces emissions. Can't stand cabin wastage? Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, LATAM and SAS are just a few airlines that have taken meaningful steps to reduce single-use plastic on flights. And while carbon-offsetting your flights throughverified schemesdoes not undo the damage, many experts agree it's better than doing nothing at all.\nAnthony Bourdain famously said that \"travel is not a reward for working, it is education for living\". It's a great philosophy for sustainable travel – and one of the mostsustainableways to learn more about the place you are visiting is to book an Indigenous-led tour.\nRecord demand for First Nations experiences in Australia has coincided with the launch of new tours for 2025, including aByron Bay storytelling walkthat offers a powerful way to connect with one of Australia's most popular coastal holiday destinations. Native and First Nation tourism is alsoboomingin North America, with the American Indian Alaska Native Tourism Association naming Oklahoma's Chickasaw Cultural Center, which offers guided tours and a daily stomp dance demonstration, as thebest cultural heritage experiencefor 2025.\nMeanwhile, citizen science and hands-on conservation activities also allow travellers to engage with destinations on a deeper level. New for 2025, Natural Habitat Adventures'Kenya Rhino Conservation Safariincludes behind-the-scenes talks with conservationists in three leading private conservancies; while Aurora Expeditions, the world's first major expedition cruise line to gain B Corp certification, recently addedEyesea, a platform designed to map global pollution and maritime hazards, to its robustcitizen science programme.\nCalculating the carbon footprint of your travels is a great way to track your impact (try the University of California, Berkeley'sCoolClimate Calculator). But there are many other ways in which apps can help. Find new ways to immerse in nature withAllTrails, which features more than 450,000 trails across the globe including itstop 25 trails to explore in 2025; and discover plant-based dining options around the world with Happy Cow, which named London as itsnumber onevegan-friendly city for 2025. Connecting travellers with more than 800,000 drinking water sources worldwide,Droplymakes it easy to avoid plastic water bottles.\nMore like this:\n•Visiting Antarctica or the Arctic? Here's how to minimise your impact\n•Is it time to change how we buy travel souvenirs?\n•The African elephant in the room: Is there such a thing as guilt-free safari?\nAnd while social media has often been blamed for contributing toovertourism and other issues,research showsit can also be used as a force for good to share positive sustainable travel experiences. Did you enjoy a visit to Vilnius, the European Green Capital for 2025? Share it with your followers and inspire others to go.\nDeceptive sustainability claims – known as greenwashing – have becomeincreasingly prevalentin the tourism industry as businesses try to capitalise on growing demand for eco-tourism. In 2024, major airlines includingAir France, Etihad, LufthansaandQantaswere accused of making misleading sustainability claims, and Booking.com dropped its Travel Sustainable programme afterregulatory backlash.\n\"New legislation adopted by Europe [called the Green Claims Directive] will make it much harder for companies to greenwash, and I think we will see that roll out globally,\" says Becken. Until then, it's on consumers to stay sharp. Use resources like Sustainable Travel International's guide toavoiding greenwashing in tourism– and \"don't underestimate the value of guest reviews\", says Leventhal. \"Platforms like Google offer honest insights into whether a property or tourism experience truly lives up to its promises.\"\nRecognising the privilege to travel freely, as only a small percentage of the world's population is able to do, is the first step in making travel a force for good. Privilege gives travellers the power to spend our travel money on experiences that are good for people and the planet, from choosinganimal-friendly experiencesto ensuring activities we participate inkeep vulnerable children safeanddon't exploit culture or communities. It can be argued that privilege doesn't only come with power, but also a responsibly to pay it forward. "

    "title": "The world's five happiest cities for 2025",
    "content": "Friends, family and a sense of community all can lead to happiness, but the environment you live in can also have a huge impact on your wellbeing. Yet, what exactly makes a \"happy city\"?\nTo find out, researchers at the Institute for the Quality of Life recently released their2025 Happy City Index, tracking 82 indicators of happiness across six major categories including Citizens, Governance, Environment, Economy, Health and Mobility. The index measured the policies that contribute to the quality of life, as well as their implementation and impact on residents.\nThe index noted that no city should ultimately be considered \"the happiest\", instead naming a group of 31 cities that made the \"Gold Cities\" list, indicating especially strong scores across all metrics. To find out what kind of policies and features truly make up a \"happy city\", we spoke to residents living in the five top-scoring places around the world.\nDenmark frequently ranks in thehappiest countries index, so perhaps it's no surprise that its capital city received the highest overall score. Copenhagen scores exceptionally well in the Environment category, which ranks its green spaces, sustainability and waste management; and the Economy category, which factors in items like GDP, median salary and overall innovation and international company presence.\nThe city also ranked well in the Citizens category, which includes cultural resources like libraries and museums, as well as resident engagement and events. For permanent resident Mari-Anne Daura, the lively food and cultural scene keeps her loving where she lives.\n\"The city is always organising free events, whether it'sThe Copenhagen Light Festival,The Human Library,Copenhagen Cookingor theDistortion Street Parties. I appreciate how much effort the city puts into curating experiences for its residents,\" she said. \"There is always something to do and something new to experience, which is what made me choose to live in Copenhagen over Stockholm.\"\nResidents also appreciate Copenhagen's emphasis on alternate and safe modes of transport. \"Nearly one-third or more of the population bikes and the city itself has its own bike lane, which many people use to commute to and from the city. The metro system also runs like clockwork,\" said resident Aaron Wertheimer.\nHe recommends visitors rent a bike and cycle over the Hans Christian Andersen bridge. \"You can see the entire city, its canals and its beautiful architecture, and you'll gain a greater appreciation for the city's aesthetic and overall atmosphere,\" he said.\nDaura recommends hopping on a water bus to experience the city from another angle. \"Check out the vibe and the wide variety of food trucks atReffen[Northern Europe's largest street food market],\" she said. \"To me, nothing is more Copenhagen than Reffen.\"\nRanked second highest in the index, Switzerland's largest city received especially high marks in the Citizens category as well as the Governance category, which measures citizen participation in government policies and access to digital services to improve life for residents.\nThis overall ease of living makes it much more stress-free, according to residents. \"As a mum of two, Zurich is the perfect place to raise a family,\" said resident Raquel Matos Gonçalves, who helps residents relocate to Switzerland through her companyExpat You. \"The main pain points of daily life are fully addressed: very safe (kids can go to school alone from kindergarten); public transport that is always on time; and Zurich is an exceptionally clean and organised city.\"\nShe adds: \"All these aspects make daily life so easy, so predictable, that they absorb the stress you'd otherwise experience.\"\nThe city has clear rules and guidelines, too. \"The unofficial motto is 'If it doesn't say yes, assume it's a no,'\" said resident Amelie Guiot, meaning that everyone stays within the bounds of the law and rules, keeping infrastructure like streets and public transport orderly and clean. She also appreciates the free drinking water from the city's 1,000-plus public fountains.\nGuiot recommends visitors check out theKunsthaus Zürich, Switzerland's biggest art museum – though the city has more than 50 other museums for more niche interests. On a sunny day, everyone migrates to lakesidebadis(public bathhouses). \"My favourite isFrauenbad Stadthausquai, a women-only wooden bathhouse,\" she said.\nThe city-state of Singapore often ranks high in various indexes, especially as one of thehappiest countries in Asiadue to its ease of doing business, cleanliness and infrastructure. In the 2025 Happiest City Index, it scored particularly well in the newly created Health metric, which tracks overall safety, public health initiatives like vaccinations and financial protection for health expenses.\nIt also ranked high in Governance, a metric where residents have seen policies ease the cost-of-living burden that has plagued other cities around the world. \"While Singapore has become really expensive, a good and early public housing scheme (HDB) along with rising housing prices has helped many Singaporeans to have not only a home but a financial asset that could potentially be cashed out for retirement or emergencies,\" said resident Hwee-Boon Yar. \"The tiny island's size and neighbours has been a strong force to ensure the city stays competitive, yet friendly with other countries.\"\nResidents also appreciate how the city's infrastructure makes it easy to enjoy life. \"Beyond convenience, Singapore's policies around green space, safety and multicultural inclusivity really stand out. You can go from pitching a global client downtown to enjoying satay by the waterfront, all in the same evening,\" says resident Samuel Huang who owns a Singapore-based business.\nFor first-time visitors, he recommends a walk through the hip neighborhood of Tiong Bahru, \"where history, food and design meet local life in the most charming way possible\", he said.\nAs Denmark's second-largest city, Aarhus often gets called the \"world's smallest big city\", something that helps residents stay happy by combining urban amenities with a small community feel. The city scored well across all metrics, but especially in Citizens, Environment and Health – factors that residents say come across in the ease of life here.\n\"Joy is seamlessly woven into daily life – not through extravagance, but through intentional design,\" said resident Carla Niña Pornelos. \"I remember cycling to a community dinner on a rooftop garden overlooking the harbour, realising how accessible happiness can be when a city genuinely supports wellbeing.\"\nMore like this:\n•Why Switzerland is home to two of the world's most liveable cities\n•What it's like to live in the happiest country on Earth\n•Why Icelanders are happier than ever\nShe mentions integrated bike lanes, green spaces and free public events that foster a sense of community. The city also prides itself on sustainability initiatives likedistrict heatingandwaste-to-energy programmes, while healthcare and education are both accessible and high-quality. \"It's not just the infrastructure, though,\" she said. \"It's the sense that people trust each other and their institutions.\"\nHome to multiple universities, the city also has an energetic feeling that especially arises after Denmark's long winter. \"When spring and summer come around, everyone comes out of hibernation ready to hang out in the parks, swim at the harbour baths or grab a beer by the canal,\" said local Mathias Steen. \"There's such a warm, laid-back vibe; people are everywhere, and the city feels alive.\"\nTo get a sense of the city, Pornelos recommends visitors take a walk along theInfinite Bridgeat sunrise. \"It's a circular pier that stretches out into the sea – quiet, surreal and emblematic of the Danish way of blending nature, art and thoughtful urban planning,\" she said. \"That single moment captures what it's like to live here: balanced, beautiful and profoundly human.\"\nAntwerp managed to inch out larger sister-city Brussels in the Happy Cities index, with higher scores in the Citizens, Government and Environment categories. Residents praise its reliable public transportation, its safe and easy cycling and its compact size – all of which making getting around quick and easy.\n\"I moved to Antwerp in my late 20s expecting a charming city with good food and beautiful architecture, but I've stayed because of how livable it is,\" said resident Grace Carter. \"There's a calm efficiency here that you start to feel in your day-to-day.\"\nShe also notes that the city invests in progressive policies like support for working families, social housing and sustainability that make life easier and more enjoyable. \"What really surprised me was how seriously Antwerp takes its green spaces and cultural life,\" she added. \"From the riverside parks to the world-class museums, it's a place where people genuinely make time to enjoy life, not just work through it.\"\nTo best see the city, she says it's worth skipping the city's well-trod museum trail to visit theSaturday market at Theaterplein. \"Grab a coffee, listen to the local chatter and just soak up that relaxed, quietly confident vibe that makes Antwerp feel like home.\" "

    "title": "Ireland's time-warped island of Owey is the perfect place to disconnect",
    "content": "Located off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life – and adventurous travellers are welcome.\nFriday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades.\nLocated off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (orUaighin Irish, meaning \"cave\") is approximately 15 minutes by boat fromCruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation – and modern-day pressures – further away.\nLast inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.\nI was spending a long weekend on Owey with theWild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group \"somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible\".\nShe explained: \"It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming.\" she added.\nPaul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height ofthe Troubles. \"My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,\" explained Cowan. \"The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].\"\nHaving since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.\nDespite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.\nSeeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.\nOwey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.\nSix of our 14-strong group were staying inOwey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.\nThe hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.\nOne local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. \"Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,\" he said.\nAlongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. \"But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,\" he added.\nGallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare – and noisy – bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.\nThe hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.\nThe car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the \"village centre\" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.\nFragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.\nBy contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren – too rough to live on – with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.\nA highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves withSelkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.\nTo enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.\nPlunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed – engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.\nMore like this:\n•The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town\n•The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'\n•Ireland's heartbreaking walk of forced emigration\n\nOur last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals – who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend – joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.\nSitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition ofthe Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, \"We're winning aren't we?\". Even though I'd only met her a couple of days before, I knew exactly what she meant: the fresh air, the island's stories relayed through song, the stars so visible in the night sky… the peacefulness of Owey.

Gazing out of the taxi from Rarotonga airport to our resort, we were immediately struck by the absence of high-rise hotels, fast-food restaurants and corporate chains. There were no traffic lights, only coconut palms lining the road, the scent of salt and frangipani drifting through the air and the jungle meeting the ocean in a seamless panorama. It felt like Hawaii in the 1960s: uncrowded, laid-back and refreshingly authentic.\nOur taxi driver pointed to a low-slung resort along the shoreline. \"No building can be higher than a coconut tree,\" she said. This isn't just a local tradition but a law set in 1965 by the Cook Islands' first premier, Albert Henry, to prevent overdevelopment. She explained that only Cook Islanders can own land, ensuring that large corporations don't dominate the landscape. We looked out onto hotels blending naturally into their surroundings and white-sand beaches ringed with long green parks, all free from litter and crowds.\nWe soon learned that this preservation of paradise is deeply intentional. Cook Islanders have made a conscious effort to ensure that Rarotonga never follows the path of overdevelopment seen in places like Honolulu. Instead, locals have committed to conservation, low-impact tourism and sustainable practices that benefit both locals and visitors. \"People come here because it is a paradise uncluttered by overdevelopment,\" explained Jeremy Goodwin, regenerative tourism manager for the Cook Islands Tourism Corporation (CITC). \"Our sacred duty as custodians of the land is to look after our paradise.\"\nThe Cook Islands, an archipelago of 15 islands between New Zealand and Hawaii, has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1965. With a total population of 21,000, the islands are divided into two groups: the Southern Cook Islands, which includes the more accessible Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and the remote Northern Cook Islands, made up of low-lying coral atolls. Cook Islanders have their own Māori language, with different dialects across the islands. And while tourism is a key industry, the islanders have ensured that sustainability remains at the nation's core.\n\"For hundreds of years, the protection of the Cook Islands relied on the traditional Ra'ui System where access to a particular resource or area is forbidden for a given period,\" explained Karla Eggelton, CEO of CITC. \"The system aims to conserve food resources and protect ecological conditions in lagoons, reefs and other marine resources.\"\nThis philosophy persists today – and extends beyond the sea. On the northern island of Pukapuka, for example, locals have practiced sustainable living for centuries, packing up their belongings and sailing by boat to another atoll within the lagoon for seasonal periods to prevent resource depletion. They fish and farm only what they need, maintaining a delicate balance with nature.\nOn arrival atThe Rarotongan Beach Resort and Lagoonarium, staff welcomed us with a warm \"Kia Orana\", a greeting that translates to \"may you live long\". It's a unique gesture of friendship from islanders renowned for their hospitality and warmth. The resort overlooks the Aroa Lagoonarium, a snorkelling haven and a sanctuary for butterflyfish, parrotfish and angelfish. Part natural lagoon and part enclosed habitat, it is designed to support marine conservation, serving both as a coral nursery and a protected area for marine life to flourish.\nAs the days passed, we saw how sustainability is woven into everyday life across the islands. At theMuri Night Market, a popular outdoor dinner option, we watched vendors prepare island dishes likeika mata(raw fish marinated in lime and coconut milk) andrukau rukau(taro leaves in coconut cream), all using local ingredients. We were struck by the market's Rent-a-Plate project, where visitors can borrow reusable plates and cutlery instead of using disposable plastic. Cook Islanders also promote clean water initiatives. We purchased reusable bottles from the visitor's centre and refilled them at free UV-treated water stations around the island, a project led by the Te Ipukarea Society to minimise plastic waste.\nBeyond sustainable dining, Cook Islanders have taken marine conservation to a global scale. In 2017, the country established theMarae Moana Marine Park, making the 15 islands the world's largest multi-use marine protected area, covering 1.9 million square kilometres. The legislation also bans large-scale commercial fishing and seabed mining within 50 nautical miles of each island.\n\"Marae Moana is the idea of shared space, a new concept of creating a sanctuary and the conservation effort that allows for shared, sustainable activity,\" said Eggelton.\nAlso offering opportunities for sustainable tourism is Aitutaki, a bucolic island neighbouring Rarotonga that's known for its snow-white sand beaches, volcanic rock, coconut palms and crystal-clear lagoons. Here thePacific Resort Aitutakihas launched a coral restoration project where guests can take part by affixing coral fragments to underwater mesh tables, helping regenerate the reef.\n\"The project is an example of Mana Tiaki or island conservation,\" explains Goodwin. \"Mana Tiaki means guardianship with a sacred purpose.\" He explained that culturally, for most Polynesians, the ocean is sacrosanct. \"The beaches bring tourists to this holiday destination, but they also connect Cook Islanders to the ocean.\"\nAs the days passed, we explored the endless powdery white-sand beaches that ring Rarotonga, from Aroa Beach where fiery, colourful sunsets painted the sky with hues of vivid orange and crimson to serene and scenic Titikaveka Beach. They were all pristine and uncrowded, lined by palm trees, parkways and picnic tables. Most were unobstructed, with no commercial buildings to obstruct the view.\nMore like this:\n•New Zealand's 'vanished world' of ancient megafauna\n•The 333 islands opening to the world\n•Saving the night sky: New Zealand's craziest experiment yet?\nAt Muri Beach, we opted for a sea turtle snorkelling tour. Our guide, Eric, explained the importance of turtles to the Cook Islands economically, environmentally and culturally. Daily tour operators earn an income by taking paying passengers to see these graceful, curious creatures. Plus, sea turtles are a key indicator of coastal ecosystem health, so monitoring and preservation are vital. Eric told us about a rescuer who found a turtle caught in a fishing net. Once freed, theTe Ara O Te Onu(Cook Island Sea Turtle Society) rehabilitated the turtle, as they have done dozens of times in the past. In addition to the society's efforts, visitors are encouraged to help track turtle movement through theCitizen Science Projectby taking photos and sending them into the programme.\nBy the time our trip had come to an end, we better understood how Cook Islanders have created a blueprint for preserving paradise by blending ancient conservation methods with modern environmental initiatives. \"It's about leaving both the people and the place better off than you found it,\" said Eggelton.\nGoodwin echoed the sentiment: This is our little paradise; if we all look after it, she will look after us.\" "

    "title": "Koh Mak: The tiny island that's redefining travel to Thailand",
    "content": "With season three of The White Lotus drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand.\nAs season three ofThe White Lotusprepares to thrust Thailand's islands into the global spotlight, drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. Here, a speck of an island named Koh Mak has quietly positioned itself as a model for sustainable tourism, offering a rare vision of what the future of travel in Thailand could be.\nHeading towards Koh Mak's southern shores by speedboat, my first impression was disarmingly simple: golden sand curving into clear shallows while coconut palms leaned towards the sea as though caught mid-bow. There were no high-rises, no blaring beach clubs. Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads.\nI checked into theMakathanee Resortnext to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea.\nAs I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand.\nPromoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) asthe country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours ­– party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south – Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earnedinternationalrecognitionfor sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future.\nWhile many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism.\n\"It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,\" Sudhidhanakul said. \"But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor – those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.\"\nIn 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers.\n\"We never worried about overtourism,\" said Sudhidhankul, \"as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.\"\nThis ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like theKoh Mak Coral Conservation Groupoffer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated byTrash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, \"Every week we clean, we educate, we change\". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.\nMore like this:\n•Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n•Here's where Asia's best female chef goes for pad Thai in Bangkok\n•Thailand's cooling rice dish to beat the heat\nI spent the next few days earnestly practising slow-life activities: reading in a hammock, snoozing in a deck chair, swimming and taking long walks along the beach looking for shells. Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes – plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga.\nI took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined atie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort.\nOne day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of theKoh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. \"When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,\" she said. \"I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.\"\nKoh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub,Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. \"We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy.\" Sudhidhanakul told me.\nYet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm – cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness – it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand.\nIt is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead. "

    "title": "The artichoke so prized that people sell fakes",
    "content": "For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands – and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.\nThe water glitters in the sunlight as Venetian farmer Guia Camerino steers her boat past thebriccole, the wooden piles that mark invisible – to non-Venetians – lanes through the lagoon. Just a few kilometres north of Venice's warren of tourist-packed streets are the islands of Sant'Erasmo and Le Vignole, known as \"the vegetable garden of Venice\" for their lush, fertile ground – and for a rare flower that grows for only 10 days a year.\nCamerino is one of just four farmers on the island of Le Vignole, and she specialises in thecarciofo violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a Venetian type of artichoke plant that produces a local delicacy known as acastraùra. The castraùre are the plant's first buds: small, tight and conical artichokes that are \"castrated\" off the plant – giving them their name – in order to allow thebotoli, larger buds (and the kind you'd probably find on your plate the rest of the year), to grow in their place.\nSpring is a busy time of year for Camerino as the violet artichokes come into bloom and must be harvested during a short window of about two weeks, with each plant only producing one castraùra a year. The tiny artichokes, half the size of a human palm, are highly prized, both for their rarity and their unique, saline taste.\n\"It's hard to describe the taste if you've never had it before,\" she explains, as we walk through her artichoke fields, the belltowers of Venice visible on the horizon. \"It's initially bitter but transforms into sweetness in the mouth. It's very versatile and easy to eat – not like a Roman artichoke that you have to peel and prepare laboriously. The castraùre are so tender that you can eat them raw.\"\nThe castraùre's rarity means that for years Venetian farmers have had to deal with counterfeit versions coming from elsewhere in Italy. The violet artichoke doesn't just grow in the Veneto – this species of plant is also grown in Tuscany, Sardinia and Sicily. But any Venetian will tell you that a true Sant'Erasmo artichoke tastes nothing like itsterrafermacounterparts. That's because the islands are positioned at the lagoon's opening to the Adriatic, which makes the soil distinctively salty – a salinity that is tempered by rainwater. There's even a festival dedicated to the artichoke (usually on the second Sunday in May) when people travel from all over the lagoon to Sant'Erasmo to eat artichoke dishes, drink artichoke-based spritzes or digestifs and buy entire pallets of the vegetable to take home before the season ends.\nIt's not easy to coax the flower out of the plant. Everything is done by hand, with no pesticides, and in Venice there's the ever-present danger of anacqua alta(seasonal flooding) that could drown the fields. An artichoke is a perennial plant that has to be cut back every summer in order to grow imperceptibly during the winter months. Now climate change is causing the season to arrive earlier and earlier.\n\"It's very worrying,\" says Camerino. \"The plant needs nine months to slowly grow. Traditionally, the castraùre were harvested on 25 April, Saint Mark's Day. But we harvested our first castraùra at the beginning of April this year. It's getting hotter earlier and earlier, and the plants won't have time to grow. Eventually, the castraùre could disappear.\"\nBecause they're so delicate, the castraùre don't get exported far out of the lagoon and are usually harvested, sold and eaten in the same day. Camerino sells directly to restaurants in Venice that \"understand the quality\" of the product. The problem, she says, is that many restaurants in Venice have stopped buying real castraùre \"because they're expensive and non-local customers can't tell the difference. So they use normal artichokes but pretend they're castraùre so they can hike up the prices.\"\nAl Covino, a Venice restaurant that focuses on local produce and traditional ingredients recognised by Italy's Slow Food presidium, makes a point of serving the castraùre when they come into season. It's a cosy space with pistachio-green roof beams, hanging plants and only 15 covers, hidden on a small street in the city's Castello neighbourhood and run by husband-and-wife team Claudio De Lauzieres and Claudia Torcellan. De Lauzieres, a Neopolitan who has been living in Venice for 12 years, rhapsodises about the local ingredients with a boyish enthusiasm: \"Neapolitan cuisine is much more well-known than Venetian cuisine, but the lagoon offers so many different environments and unique tastes. The castraùre symbolise the richness of the land here.\"\nHe prepares three castraùre dishes: a silky, gently sautéed version that doesn't just melt on the tongue but entirely disappears, leaving a subtly sweet aftertaste; tagliolini in a velvety artichoke sauce; and raw shavings of the vegetable in a salad with oil, parmesan and a hint of lemon zest. He watches my face as I take a bite of the salad and grins at my expression of surprise at the tiny bud's powerful taste. Its flavour instantly takes me back to Camerino's boat and the smell of the salty lagoon air whipping past my face.\nOn Sant'Erasmo, local farmer Carlo Finotello has been working for years to crack down on the falsely labelled castraùre that appear in markets and shops across the lagoon. He runs the farmI Sapori di Sant'Erasmowith his brother Claudio and is also the president of theConsorzio del Carciofo Violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a consortium created in 2004 to promote the local violet artichoke. Its label is a mark of quality and authenticity.\n\"Some vegetable sellers take the consorzio label and stick it on other crates of normal artichokes,\" Finotello explained. \"Or they will buy some castraùre but then mix them in with normal artichokes so they're still making a bit extra.\"\nWhen the consortium receives a tip-off about producers passing off Tuscan artichokes as the Sant'Erasmo version, Finotello contacts them directly to ask them to desist – but the consortium isn't a policeman, he says, and they have no power to issue fines, nor the time or money to take them to court. He says that it's vital to only buy castraùre from a local producer, and to always make sure that they have the consortium's label, in order to protect the centuries-old tradition of growing them.\nMore like this:\n•Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n•The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n•Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food\nI visit Finotello at his farm to see him harvest the castraùre. It's a muggy day with a hot, salty breeze, and the earth is springy after days of rain. The artichoke plants are slowly opening up in the sun. Finotello shows me how to cut a castraùra gently off the stalk with the traditional curved knife, which he holsters in the pocket of his overalls between rows. The plants used to be fertilised withscoasse(garbage in Venetian dialect), a mix of fish bones and old crab shells. \"We can't do that anymore because there's too much plastic in the food system,\" Finotello tells me, shrugging. \"We'd just be feeding the plants plastic.\"\nWhen he finishes harvesting the small field, he counts how many castraùre he picked: 105. He then dumps the basket in the back of his trailer and looks at me, grinning. \"Now you need to eat some.\"\nAt the farmhouse, his mother, Mirella Bubacco, is holding court in a kitchen busy with the detritus of the recent Italian Easter celebration: chocolate eggs and endless cups of espresso next to slices ofcolomba, a type of Italian Easter cake. Mirella is warm, businesslike – and very chatty.\n\"Don't ever eat it as an antipasto!\" she warns me, a paring knife in one hand. \"The taste lingers in your mouth, and it'll alter the taste of your first course.\" She insists that it is best eaten in the very simple Venetian style: uncooked, julienned, with a ribbon of light-tasting olive oil, a bit of salt and shavings of Grana Padano. \"The earth here on Sant'Erasmo is all the condiment you need!\" \n"

    "title": "The European nation where bears roam free",
    "content": "As Romania's bear population grows, so do the opportunities for travellers to come face to face with the predators in a responsible way.\nRomania is home to the largest population of wild brown bears in Europe outside of Russia, with as many as13,000 bearsliving in and around the largely untouched forests of the Carpathian Mountains. But while bear-spotting haslong been a tourist attraction in Romania, it historically didn't involve venturing into the forest.\n\"It wasn't that long ago that it was commonplace to see a bear kept in a cage outside of businesses here to attract customers,\" host Reece Parkinson explained in a recent episode of BBC'sThe Travel Show.\nWhen Romania joined the European Union in 2007, the country began to adhere to theEU Zoos Directive, which issues guidelines for how captive animals are to be treated. In the past 18 years, the country has turned to more humane and sustainable ways to show off one of Europe's last truly wild corners and the brown bears who thrive here.\nBrown bears have roamed the woods and mountains of Europe formillions of years. However, their numbers dwindled significantly as human civilisation expanded. Today, it's estimated that roughly 36,000 bears live in the European part of Russia, but new research conducted by Romania's Forestry Research Institute reveals that the nation's brown bear population ismuch higher than previously estimated– a fact that has brought both opportunity and challenges to surrounding communities.\nOn one hand, sustainable bear tourism in Romania is growing. Numerous tour operators likeOutdoor HolidaysandMuch Better Adventuresnow offer visitors guided \"bear-sighting\" hiking trips into the forests where brown bears live. This, in turn, also brings economic opportunities to the country's more rural communities and encourages continued conservation of the animals' habitat.\nThere's even a dedicated safe haven:Libearty Bear Sanctuary,nestled in the southern Carpathian Mountains in the town of Zarnesti, is the world's largest brown bear sanctuary. It not only rescues and provides medical care to formerly captive bears who can't be released into the wild, but also offers public tours, allowing visitors them to see the bears in a 69-hectare expanse of oak forests and grasslands.\n\"In the last 20 years, Cristina Lapis and her team [at Libearty Bear Sanctuary] have given a home to over 130 bears here in Transylvania,\" said Parkinson.\nUnfortunately, not everyone is enthusiastic about their furry neighbours. As the bear population flourishes, so do dangerous encounters with humans.\nSome local farmers, many of whom have lost livestock to the bears, have lobbied for culling Romania's brown bear population. Visitors have also had conflicts with the animals, often because of unexpected encounters while hiking the mountains – several of which haveturned deadly. Still Lapis, who runs the sanctuary, insists that such encounters are not the norm.\n\"I know hundreds of thousands of cases where people who are used to the forest saw a bear and nothing happened. So [there] must be something special that an accident happened,\" said Lapis. \"When you go in the forest… it's important to make noise. If you make noise the animal knows you're coming and goes away.\"\nEfforts are underway to try to find a happy medium that protects the bears and keeps visitors and livestock as safe as possible. The animals are protected under Romanian law, andreforestation and educational effortsare underway to prevent the bears from entering into human territory to feed and to teach humans what to do when they encounter a bear in the woods.\nMost life-threatening encounters with bears aredue to human error, usually when a human startles a bear or interacts inappropriately with cubs, making mother bears defensive. Therefore, when hiking in bear country – whether in Romania or elsewhere – it's important to talk loudly or clap your hands to give the animals time to avoid you. If you come upon a bear accidentally, make yourself as large as possible and back away.\n\"We cannot live alone [in the wilderness],\" Lapis said. \"We have to learn to share.\" "

    "title": "The unstoppable rise of digital detox retreats",
    "content": "It's not just a White Lotus thing: A growing number of resorts and retreats are asking their guests to put their digital devices away during their stay.\nWhen Ophelia Wu went toEremitoin Italy she was hoping for a stress-free experience. \"I was living a hectic life in London, and I found it overwhelming,\" she said. \"I needed a break. I heard about this former monastery in Umbria, and I was curious about it.\"\nShe booked a three-night stay at the hotel, which has no wi-fi or phone signal, no tech and no TVs; just brick walls, basic bedrooms and candlelight. The buzz of bumblebees replaced the buzz of her notifications.\n\"When I left, I was reluctant to turn my phone back on,\" she said. \"I got used to the peace of being unbothered and the lack of urgency.\"\nShe's not alone: offline travel is one of thetrends of the year so far. According to the2025 Hilton Trends Report, 27% of adults planning to travel say that they intend to reduce social media use during their holidays. Echoing this interest, global luxury home-rental platformPlum Guidehas seen a 17% rise in searches for unplugged, tech-lite properties. In Mexico, the luxuryGrand Velas Resortshas launched aDigital Detox Programthat would not be out of place onThe White Lotus, complete with a \"Detox Concierge\" to whisk away all electronic devices on arrival.\nWhat's striking about this trend is that it's available to everyone, it costs nothing and it's about giving less. It seems that people have become so dissatisfied with digital life that they are willing to pay more to escape it.\nWhile it has become the norm to use tech to facilitate travel logistics – bookings, check ins and itineraries – when it starts to play a starring role in the holiday experience, it can feel like the opposite of getting away from it all. According toIt's Time To Log Off, the average person spends a day each week online, and 34% of people have checked Facebook in the last 10 minutes. Sixty-two percent of polled adults, they say, \"hate\" how much time they spend on their phones.\nMartin Dunford is the founder and CEO ofCool Places, a website that has curated hotels, B&Bs, pubs and self-catering accommodation across the UK since 2012. \"We used to have a tag to show which properties had wi-fi,\" he said. \"Now we're adding a 'no wi-fi' tag.\"\nHis site lists34 places to enjoy a digital detox stay, from a Cornish eco-yurt to a boathouse on Ullswater in the Lake District, and the list is growing. Intrigued by the interest in stays where guests can disconnect, Dunford has been working with the University of Greenwich and the University of East Anglia to analyse what happens to people when they go offline on holiday. They found a distinct pattern:\n\"Guests go stir crazy in the first 24 hours,\" he said. \"But after 48 hours they are well adjusted and start getting into other activities. At the end of a three-day stay – or longer – we find guests may be happy to have their phones back or can be a bit take it or leave it about it.\"\nYou might wonder why anyone needs to book a special holiday to get off their phones: can't they just unplug themselves? But, as that difficult first 24 hours experience shows, it's not so simple: habits are hard to break, and digital addiction is particularly tough. When university researchers investigated digital-free tourism in 2019, theydiscoveredthat many travellers experienced anxiety and frustration initially, but these emotions led to acceptance, enjoyment and liberation over time. Without having a boundary put in place by an external figure or taking away the option to use screens, those positive feelings might not have been reached at all.\nAn hour from Dublin in idyllic rural Ireland, Rosanna Irwin knows all about tech overload. She's the owner and founder ofSamsú, a series of off-grid cabins in the Irish countryside, a growing business that she set up in 2024 as a reaction to her experiences leading a chronically online life.\n\"I started my career at Facebook,\" she said, \"and I was working all hours with global teams, replying to all messages, in systems where we had 'unlimited holidays' – which really meant it was harder to justify taking a day off. Ultimately being online all the time like this really broke me.\"\nIt took a trip to the quiet island of Samsø in Denmark for Irwin to see what happens when you must switch off.\n\"I spent three days with no internet there and came home feeling cured,\" she said, \"I quit my job, moved back to Ireland and spent the next eight months working on this idea. I felt this strong gut instinct to do it – and I hadn't listened to my gut for a long time.\"\nIrwin now operates two cabins, each within a 90-minute drive of an Irish city, with three more due to open this summer. In each simple space there is no wi-fi or technology, so the only tweets guests will hear are from the birds. Board games, books and a radio are provided, and the cabins come with simple cooking facilities. In case of emergency, every cabin has a phone, but it's a special, stripped back version, preloaded with podcasts and music but very little else.\n\"We're not only getting people offline,\" Irwin said, \"we're also encouraging them to discover their creativity and mindfulness. We will be launching a cookbook this summer with one-pot recipes and foraged ingredients to give people an extra purpose as well.\"\nHector Hughes is a co-founder ofUnplugged, a group of 40 tech-detox cabins in the UK and Spain. His business is also seeing growth: they expect to have 60 cabins by the end of the year. His journey, with his co-founder Ben Elliott, mirrors Irwin's: burnout and dissatisfaction in a start-up career, leading to an epiphany while on a break from tech.\n\"I was at breaking point in 2019,\" he said, \"and I went on a retreat to a Buddhist temple in the Himalayas. I was without my phone for 10 days. I had never had a break like it before.\"\nHe returned home, quit his job and decided to create a tech-free option like a retreat, but decoupled from religion and philosophy.\n\"So much of it is really about getting offline and getting into nature,\" he said. \"Just being offline for three days can have a profound effect on you. You feel a deep sense of calm at the end – it's quite surreal.\"\nMore like this:\n•Ireland's time-warped island of Owey is the perfect place to disconnect\n•A better way to 'raw-dog' travel\n•Norway's creative, isolated Arctic hideaway\nThe Unplugged experience offers modern solar-powered Scandinavian-style cabins in rural locations such as the green fields of rural Cheshire, a dark sky reserve in Exmoor and in the forested mountains of the pre-Pyrenees in rugged Catalonia. Inside, there are blankets, board games and a lockbox for devices – so guests must stay strong and lock their devices away themselves. Unplugged's mission is to make it aspirational to have time away from your phone, and to feel good about doing it.\nHe's seen some interesting results so far: \"People come away looking 10 years younger,\" he said, \"and couples in particular are more connected. If you've been together for a decade, you've probably never had a day together without a phone. The experience offers you an intense connection you might not have experienced before.\"\nWhile Hughes and his team are on a mission to make being offline an aspirational experience, Dunford thinks it could be a regular one.\n\"The detox holiday is an inevitable backlash against our hyperconnected world,\" he said. \"But in time, it might not be that unusual. Maybe being away without wi-fi on holiday will become the norm?\" "

Now, a new festival reveals the similar journeys of Black music and cuisine.\n\"Womp, womp, womp.\" That's the sound, according to Grammy Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning musicianRhiannon Giddens, of a sharp-rimmed glass cutting into just-right biscuit dough. Coming from Giddens' mouth, the timbre translates as a low note plucked from a double bass.\nGiddens is an American scholar-musician whose folk, country and blues music illuminates the African lineage of the banjo and celebrates the legacy of the Black string band. But in 2020, at the outset of pandemic lockdowns, Giddens found herself craving something seemingly less academic: biscuits. Not the crisp British variety that Americans call \"cookies\" and \"crackers\". Not crumbly, sweetened scones – those she could buy in abundance in her adopted city of Limerick, Ireland. No, what Giddens wanted were flaky, buttery biscuits with a definitive rise, the kind that are ubiquitous across the American South.\nFive years later, after tweaking her formula and method, Giddens has landed on what she believes is a near-perfect biscuit recipe. Her pandemic baking obsession even inspired her newBiscuits & Banjosmusic festival, which showcases the similarly winding journeys of Black music and food.\nDuring the pandemic, Giddens was collaborating with Italian musician Francesco Turrisi on the albumThey're Calling Me Home. \"Francesco and I were thinking about the food that we couldn't get because we couldn't go home,\" said Giddens, who grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina. \"For me, that turned into, 'How do I make biscuits?'\"\nLiving in Ireland, Giddens had to rework basic elements of biscuit composition. How would Irish butter, with its higher fat content, impact the texture and rise? Which European flour would yield a comparable crumb? That's to say nothing of technique. \"It turned into an obsession pretty quickly,\" she said.\nGiddens practiced until she arrived at a flawless variation with an adapted recipe from Southern Living magazine. First, she grates frozenKerrygold butterinto frozen, siftedWhite Lily flour(the colder the ingredients, the better). Next, she pours in thick buttermilk, and after a cursory stir, she dumps the wet mixture onto a heavily floured counter. \"I start folding, turn, fold, turn, fold, turn, pat it out. I don't bother with a rolling pin,\" said Giddens. \"I was doing four sets of folds, and then I threw in an extra one. The biscuits wentpoof.\"\nThen comes cutting the dough – the womp – before she places the biscuits cheek-to-cheek on pre-cut parchment paper. Meanwhile, there's a sheet pan heating in the oven at 475F, a critical step that yields crispy bottoms. At first, Giddens confessed, she often underbaked her dough. Now, she checks how done it is after 12 to 15 minutes by gently pressing her fingers on top and jiggling a nascent biscuit; too much movement signals a gummy centre.\nGiddens' ideal biscuit has a certain flakiness. It's sturdy enough to hold bacon without crumbling, and tender enough to enjoy with jam. During the years it took her to master biscuit making, They're Calling Me Home won a Grammy Award for best folk album. She also composed and sang inOmar, an opera that earned the Pulitzer Prize, and played banjo and viola on Beyoncé's hit single,Texas Hold 'Em. Along the way, she started to see how biscuits integrated into her life's work of tracing the complex history of music.\n\"Food and music have similar cultural markers. Like food, music moves with people, and it changes as people move. So, it made sense to connect them,\" said Giddens. \"Biscuits and banjos happen to be two of my obsessions.\"\nBiscuits, like the banjo, have a complex lineage. Their roots lie in dry, twice-baked breads, or rusks, that the British called \"bisquites\" after the Latin phrasepanis bicoctus, or \"twice-baked bread\". But in the American South, particularly in the hands of Black cooks, they became soft, leavened symbols of class, skill and Southern identity.\nIn the bookThe Biscuit: The History of a Very British Indulgence, Lizzie Collingham writes that biscuits were an \"an indispensable tool of empire building\". Indeed, these nonperishable breads sustained soldiers and sailors for millennia, and in the early 1600s, English settlers in Jamestown, Virginia, survived on a supply of biscuits brought from the motherland.\nA distinctly Southern biscuit began to emerge in the 18th Century. On Royal Navy ships, tough, dry biscuits had earned the nickname \"purser's nuts\". But in finer settings on both sides of the Atlantic, bakers added sugar, citrus and spices. The Virginia Housewife, an 1824 cookbook by Mary Randolph, includes a recipe for Tavern Biscuits, whose ingredients included flour, sugar, butter, mace, nutmeg, brandy and milk. It also shared a recipe for beaten biscuits.\n\"[Beaten biscuits] were the most common biscuit in the South,\" saidMichael Twitty, a James Beard Award-winning food writer and historian. \"The lore behind them is true. A Black child, normally a little boy, would sit there with the back of an axe or a club, and on a clean log, he would literally beat this dough over 1,000 times.\"\nThe thin, crunchy beaten biscuit closely resembled what Americans consider a cracker, but this violent, repetitive thrashing – only possible with enslaved labour – produced a slight rise and delicate crumb onto which diners would drape slices of country ham. White flour was still a luxury in the antebellum South, and beaten biscuits were an edible stamp of wealth.\n\"Biscuits have been a demarcation line in terms of class and race,\" said Toni Tipton-Martin, a food journalist and historian whose work includes the bookThe Jemima Code: Two Centuries of African American Cookbooks. \"African Americans have traditionally been known for making cornmeal and more coarse grain breads. Wheat flour was not available in early America, and it was an expression of affluence to be able to make biscuits.\"\nHowever, it was chemical leavening agents that created the soft, layered Southern biscuit as we know it today. At first, bakers used saleratus (potassium bicarbonate) and soda (sodium bicarbonate). The buttermilk in Giddens' recipe dates to these early leavening agents, which required an acid to activate. Then in 1856, Eben Norton Horsford patented baking powder, officially giving rise to the poof of the Southern biscuit.\nAs milling technology improved in the late 19th Century, Southern-grown soft winter wheat, (which was better for so-called \"quick breads\" than sturdy loaves) gained popularity. When flour prices dropped, biscuits became a marker of social mobility across racial lines, transforming a Sunday treat into an everyday staple.\nMore like this:\n•How rice shaped the American South\n•The surprising origin of fried chicken\n•Pig ear sandwich: An iconic dish of the American South\nAmerican food industrialised in the 20th Century, and so did biscuits. An unnamed Black cook for Pullman Company trains used a premade flour mix to produce biscuits on the fly; his work inspired Bisquick, the first commercial biscuit mix. In 1931, Lively Willoughby patented canned refrigerated biscuit dough. Biscuit diversity flourished, too, such ascathead biscuitsand North Carolina'shoop cheese-filled variety. Bakers embraced efficientdrop biscuitsand airyangel biscuits, which use baking powder, baking soda and yeast.\nBiscuits had transformed from a seafaring staple to a luxury good made by enslaved cooks to a food of the working class. Farmers and labourers carried biscuits slathered with jam or stacked with ham in their lunchpails. Twitty recalled a line from South Carolinean journalist Ben Roberston's memoir,Red Hills and Cotton: \"To fry chickens, to boil coffee, to boil rice and to make good biscuits were the four requirements we demanded of cooks.\"\nThe year of Giddens' birth, biscuits broke into America's fast-food pantheon. In 1977, Bojangles, a fried chicken and biscuits counter, first opened in Charlotte, North Carolina; there are now 800 Bojangles across 17 states. The same year, a single location of Hardee's added ham and sausage biscuits to its breakfast menu. Across Hardee's franchises, workers bake more than 100 million biscuits annually. In the 1980s, Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds took biscuits nationwide.\nButtered, dotted with blueberries, smothered in sausage gravy, split and sandwiched, biscuits had become wholly American without losing their Southern accent. \"I see this food as graduated British, even if there's nothing like it in the British Isles, not even scones. You can't find them in Africa,\" said Twitty. \"So they're this combination of all those different streams and elements that make America what it is.\"\nWith Biscuits & Banjos, Giddens wanted to create a festival that would build community and inspire cross-disciplinary collaboration, and the three-day event in Durham, North Carolina (25-27 April) brought together Black musicians, activists, historians and chefs. Her Grammy-winning band,The Carolina Chocolate Drops, reunited for the first time in a decade, performing songs from acclaimed African American fiddlerJoe Thompsonand guitaristEtta Baker.New Dangerfield, a Black string band of Giddens acolytes, played a sweet and earnest New Orleans waltz, whileNiwel Tsumbuconnected the musical traditions of his native Congo to the American South.\nBy day, festival-goers ate biscuits from restaurants on a downtownDurham biscuit trailand bought tote bags that read: \"Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit\". They also gathered in an armoury, which had held a square dance the night before, for a talk with Tipton-Martin, Twitty and Dr Cynthia Greenlee on biscuit history and the contributions of Black cooks to one of the US South's most iconic baked goods.\nGiddens hopes to stage the festival again in Durham in 2026, creating a space where food and music continue to challenge narratives, uplift Black stories and contribute new ideas to storied traditions.\n\"Food and music are such a great way to talk about culture,\" says Giddens. \"They're disarming. They're innocent. They are shaped by the forces around them, whether that's political or cultural. The more we can understand that, I think, the more we can understand ourselves.\"\nRhiannon Giddens' \"They're Biscuits, Not Scones\" recipe\nAdapted from Southern Living magazine\nMakes 10-12 biscuits\nMethod\nStep 1\nMeasure a piece of parchment paper to fit your sheet pan; be sure to make it longer but exactly as wide, so you can use the overhang to lift the sheet when there are biscuits on top. Set aside.\nStep 2\nSift the flour into a bowl, then grate in the frozen butter (I use a box grater, the large holes side). Toss together briefly (but no need to work the butter into the dough). Put in the freezer.\nStep 3\nWhile the bowl is in the freezer, preheat the oven to 475F. If you have an electric oven, put the pan in the oven and heat it up without the parchment paper. If you have a gas oven, you can keep the pan out of the oven and place the parchment paper in it. This is all in pursuit of nice crispy bottoms.\nStep 4\nMake a well in the middle of the butter/flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk. Always have more on hand in case you need it – I usually have to add a bit. Stir until it starts to come together. It should be pretty sticky and a bit wet. Turn it out onto a well-floured surface and pat it into a rectangle (you can use a rolling pin if it helps).\nStep 5\nFold the dough in thirds like a letter and flatten out, then turn and do it again in the other direction. Do this whole process at least once more, for a total of 4 sets of folds. This is what takes the most experience; you’ll eventually learn how much handling is enough. Aim for handling less, not more.\nStep 6\nRoll or pat out and start cutting your biscuits; use a biscuit cutter or a glass and be careful not to twist (that is a myth that will end up actually curtailing your biscuit's rise). If the dough is in that sweet spot of not too wet but not too worked, the cutter will not stick to the dough, and if it's a glass it will make a nice little \"womp\" sound.\nStep 7\nPlace the biscuits on the parchment paper in a honeycomb pattern so that there are no spaces. This will help the biscuits rise. If you like biscuits that are crispy all around and not as tall, you can place them with space around them or only touching on the sides.\nStep 8\nMove the biscuit-laden parchment with the overhang onto the pan, this will take practice. You may brush melted butter on top of the biscuits at this point.\nStep 9\nBake at 475F for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned. You can feel they are done by shaking one with your fingertip on top; if they are too moveable, they aren't quite set.\nStep 10\nPlace them in a basket lined with a tea towel and cover; they will stay nice and moist this way. Put the leftovers straight into the fridge to be reheated in the oven when ready. "

    "title": "What you need to know about US Real ID",
    "content": "Starting 7 May, many American citizens and residents will need a new form of ID to board domestic flights.\nThis week, the US government is set to implement a major change to its air travel policy that has been nearly 20 years in the making.\nStarting 7 May, US citizens and residents will no longer be able to use a standard driver's licence or state ID to board domestic flights. Instead, travellers will need to present aREAL ID, passport or other acceptable form of identification at airport security checkpoints.\nHere's what you need to know.\nThe new REAL ID is a federally compliant licence or non-driver ID issued by a state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that meets new security standards at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints. The new IDs look very similar to existing driver's licences or state IDs but are recognisable by a gold or black star located in the top-right corner.\n\"The Real ID requirement bolsters safety by making fraudulent IDs harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists,\" Adam Stahl, TSA Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator explained in astatement. \"TSA will implement REAL ID effectively and efficiently, continuing to ensure the safety and security of passengers while also working to minimise operational disruptions at airports.\"\nAll American travellers over the age of 18 will be required to present a REAL ID or anotherTSA-acceptable form of identification, such as a passport or permanent resident card, in order to board domestic flights anywhere in the US and its territories.\nEven travellers with TSA PreCheck, are not exempt from these requirements. However, children under the age of 18 are still allowed to fly domestically without identification.\nTo obtain a REAL ID, travellers should usethis mapand click on their home state or territory to determine what specific documentation they'll need to apply. Most travellers will generally need to make an appointment at their local DMV and bring in documents that prove their identity and lawful status. These may include proof of identity and citizenship via a passport, birth certificate or green card; proof of address in the form of utility bills or bank statements; and a social security card.\nApplicants will be issued temporary identification while the REAL ID is processed and mailed, which can take several weeks. The cost to obtain the new ID varies from state to state, so it's recommended to check with the local Department of Motor Vehicles.\nAmerican travellers without a REAL ID, passport or other acceptable form of identification will be subject to additional screening and may be turned away and not allowed to board their flights. According to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)website, without a REAL ID: \"The TSA officer may ask you to complete an identity verification process, which includes collecting information such as your name and current address to confirm your identity.\"\nMore like this:\n•The big changes coming to UK and European travel in 2025\n•The digital aircraft: How technology is reshaping air travel\n•How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\nIn addition to a passport, the DHS website notes that anenhanced IDor a DHS-trusted traveller card such as Global Entry may be presented in lieu of a REAL ID. However, the DHS warns that this list is subject to change, so travellers should be sure to double check with TSA to confirm before arriving at the airport.\nFollowing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 9/11 Commission recommended the US Congress pass theREAL ID Actin order to establish more stringent security standards for driver's licences and other identification documents. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and opposition from state governments, led to several postponements of the REAL ID rollout since the Act was originally passed.\nWhile the rule only applies directly to American travellers, it's believed that anyone travelling within the US may be affected by these new requirements, as longer lines are expected at airport security checkpoints. Travellers are encouraged to arrive early for flights in order to accommodate potential longer wait times and additional screenings, ideally two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international flights.

    "title": "The South American country supplying Mother's Day flowers",
    "content": "Every May, millions of flowers make their way to mums across the US for Mother's Day, and the majority come from one nation.\nSo, where do these flowers come from?\nThat would be Colombia, which exportsmore than $2bnworth of cut flowers each year, making it the second-largest flower producer in the world after the Netherlands, and the largest single supplier to the United States. Nearly 80% of Colombia's flowers (or $1.62bn) end up in the US, so if you're Stateside, chances are that the stems in your Mother's Day bouquets originated in this South American country.\nA 2024articlein the American Journal of Transportation noted that in just 21 days, more than 400 LATAM Airlines flights carrying 24,000 tonnes of flowers (roughly 552 million flower stems), took off from Colombia and neighbouring Ecuador. But thanks to rising inflation and US President Donald Trump issuinga 10% baseline tariffon most all imported goods from Colombia, many experts say that Mother's Day bouquets arelikely to be more expensivein the US this year.\n\"Flowers are not something we can buy in advance and hold on to, they have to be cut fresh,\" shopping expert Trae Bodge recentlytold The Today Show. \"Consumers are really going to feel that pinch when they're buying flowers [this year].\"\nPrior to the 1960s, most American bouquet-bound flowers were cut fresh in California, but they were expensive. Colombia's modern floral export industry traces its roots back to the Cold War. Then in 1961, US President John F Kennedy created the $100bnAlliance for Progressinitiative, which aimed to combat the threat of communism by enhancing economic cooperation between the US and Latin America.Colombia became a key focus of the administration, and one of the programme's first tasks was to help Colombia develop its agricultural industry.\nKennedy even visited Colombia's capital, Bogotá, in 1961, whennearly one-thirdof the city's 1.5 million people swarmed the streets to catch a glimpse of the US President and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It was the largest reception JFK had while in office, and today, one of the city's densest neighbourhoods is still namedKennedy.\nThings began to bloom in the 1970s when improvements in air transportation made it easier to connect Colombia's fertile soil with the booming demand for flowers in the US and abroad. Entrepreneur and floriculture hobbyist Edgar Wells, whose export company sent the first shipment of cut flowers from Bogota to Miami in 1965, once compared Colombia's flower industry to the mythical legend of El Dorado, saying: \"After 400 years, the true riches of El Dorado have been discovered … a permanent source of riches for all Colombians, for all time.\"\nIn 1991, the industry got an additional boost with the passage of theAndean Trade Preference Act(ATPA), which offered many South American countries a way to import a wide variety of goods duty-free, including flowers. The country now exports billions of flowers to the US every year, and despiteproblematic labour practicesand adwindling work force, it still specialises in growing some of the most popular flowers found in bouquets or given as gifts – including roses, carnations and orchids.\nThe impressive breadth of flowers grown in Colombia is partly due to the country's unique landscapes. The countryside surrounding city of Facatativá, outside of Bogota, is a hotspot for flower farms. The area's setting on a high plain savanna in the shadow of the Andes mountains makes an ideal space for flower growing, with more than73% of Colombia's floral productiontaking place there. Further north, the area around Medellín accounts for an additional 24%.\nSince 1957, Medellín has celebrated its growing floral heritage with the annualFeria de las Flores(Flower Festival), which is now the biggest cultural event in the city. Known as the \"city of eternal spring\" because of its beautiful year-round weather, Medellín explodes with colour every August as the 10-day flower festival kicks off. The event, which takes place in downtown Medellín, features food, artists, vendors and – of course – flowers.\nMore like this:\n•A local expert's guide to seeing the most beautiful tulips in the Netherlands\n•A journey to Earth's most remote flower\n•The flower that blooms every 12 years\nThe festival is best known for the elaboratesilleterosparade. The term silleteros, or \"saddle men\", refers to the practice of men carrying goods on large circular plates worn on their backs. The tradition started as a way to transport produce, goods and even people through the mountainous terrain of the Andes, however it has become synonymous with flower sellers in Colombia because of the use of these back plates to transport flowers from farms in the mountains to the cities where they're sold.\nDuring the flower festival, silleteros create elaborate artistic floral arrangements, which often depict important historical and cultural moments with flowers and carry them through the streets on these traditional plates.\nA more common, but no less beautiful, way to experience Colombia's floral heritage is by visiting one of the many flower markets in cities around the country. For example, one of Medellín’s famous farmers' markets, thePlacita de Flóressells locally grown flowers alongside other goods and produce, as does theMercado de Paloquemaoin Bogotá. Some flower farms, also welcomeguests, so that visitors can see exactly where their favourite blooms originate, while also directly supporting the people who grow them.\nThis article was originally published in 2024 and has since been updated.

    "title": "Why now is the time to explore outer East London",
    "content": "A few miles from East London's perennially hip neighbourhoods, an explosion of art and culture is transforming a once-neglected stretch into one of the city's hottest destinations.\nEast London. Two words that, if you know anything about the UK's capital, often conjure up opposing opinions.\nThere are those who mourn its supposedlywaning hip factor– regaling stories of 1980s warehouse art shows or squat parties – while deploring the rampant commercialism of its supercharged epicentre, Shoreditch. Others, meanwhile, will rave about new independent galleries or small-plate restaurants in nearby Dalston, Bethnal Green or Hackney. Yet, the general consensus is that East London's long-buzzing arts and food scenes are continuing to move ever further out, driven – as in other world cities – by the relentless search for affordability.\nBut a few miles east of these oversubscribed neighbourhoods are two boroughs that are lesser known to visitors and have been quietly emerging as London's next artsy enclave: Waltham Forest and Newham. Stretching north from Stratford up to Leyton and Walthamstow, this  once-unfashionable outer area hasn't always matched East London's brand of cool. And yet in spring 2025, it's witnessing a cultural explosion, with new museums, theatres and bars and some of the city's biggest arts openings that are putting this under-the-radar corner of London on the map.\nThe catalyst for these boroughs' rise was the 2012 London Olympics, which transformed the area's scrapyards and brownfield land intoQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park– an oasis of rivers, canals and water meadows bordered by Stratford, Leyton and Hackney.\n\"The Olympics brought a huge amount of investment in infrastructure, transport links and housing,\" said Britannia Morton, co-chief executive of Sadler's Wells, the world-famous Islington-based dance theatre founded in the 18th Century. \"The Olympic Park, where our newSadler's Wells Eastis based, was created converting marshland into this beautiful environment.\"\nSadler's Wells East, which opened in February 2025, is located in East Bank, a £1.1bn new waterside cultural quarter in the Olympic Park. \"[It was] formerly known as Fridge Mountain – a dumping ground for old electronic appliances,\" said Morton. The first landmark to open here was theUniversity of the Arts' London College of Fashionin October 2023, which has galleries and a cafe open to the public. Sadler's Wells East was built in Italian red brick and houses a 550-seat state-of-the-art auditorium and six dance studios.\n\"Whether you're interested in ballet, hip-hop, kathak or contemporary, our eclectic programme brings the most innovative work created locally, nationally and internationally to Stratford,\" said Morton. Visitors can enjoyfree eventsin its public spaces, including lunchtime dance classes on the community dance floor, as well as a bar and restaurant. There are panoramic views from its rooftop over theLondon Aquatics Centre, Sir Anish Kapoor's 114.5mArcelorMittal Orbit(the UK's largest sculpture) and theLondon Stadium.\nAcross the park at theHere Eastinnovation and tech campus (formerly the London Olympics Media Centre) is the glass-frontedV&A East Storehouse, opening 31 May 2025. It's the first half of the new V&A East, whose South Kensington-basedoriginalis the world's largest museum of applied arts, decorative arts and design, with more than 2.8 million objects in its permanent collection.\nThis first instalment is essentially a new home for the V&A East's reserve collection (hence the name \"Storehouse\"), and \"a magical new behind-the-scenes museum experience\", according to its deputy director and COO Tim Reeve. With 100 curated mini displays, its half a million works range from the Glastonbury Festival Archive to Dior haute couture and mid-century furniture. Its world-firstOrder an Objectexperience allows anyone to book an appointment to view anything from Roman frescoes to Elton John's costumes. It will also be home to the newDavid Bowie Centre, opening 13 September 2025, displaying the singer's outfits, lyrics and archive.\n\"It's a new standard for access to national collections,\" said Reeve. \"We're encouraging visitors to feel empowered to make their own journeys through the V&A's global collections.\"\nThe second half, the five-storey V&A East Museum, is opening in East Bank in spring 2026. Its main exhibition hall will celebrate leading artists, designers and performers in major shows, and its galleries will narrate stories of East London's creative and manufacturing heritage.\nElsewhere in East Bank,BBC Music Studios, which will house the BBC Symphony Orchestra and host recording sessions and live performances, is slated to open in late 2026 or early 2027.\nAnd that's not all. A couple of miles north in Walthamstow, another major cultural opening is happening. While this diverse north-east London suburb has long been thriving – its pretty village centre, some of which dates to the 15th Century, is indeed a gentrification hotspot – the imposing newSoho Theatre Walthamstowwill further raise the neighbourhood's profile when it opens on 2 May 2025. A former cinema designed in 1930 by architect Cecil Masey, the distinctive building was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the 13th-Century Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. In its mid-20th-Century heyday, it also hosted gigs by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones – before closing in 2003.\nMore like this:\n•London Overground: Four stops to explore the 'real' London\n•Five unusual historical experiences in London\n•See another side to London at eight of its most unusual tourist attractions\nWhen it finally reopens, with its original Art Deco stylings revived, the Soho Theatre Walthamstow will have a 960-seat Grade II-listed auditorium, studio spaces, four bars and a restaurant. (In comparison, its current West End location has a capacity of just 240.)\n\"This is the first time we've had a professional theatre in the area,\" said executive assistant Annie Jones, who worked on the restoration project for more than five years. \"The programme will list up to nine shows a night – a mix of comedy, cabaret and theatre all rooted in its community. Waltham Forest has always been welcoming, with its vibrancy, multiculturalism and openness, and its spirit has only grown.\"\nConnecting Stratford, the Olympic Park and Walthamstow is Leyton. This once-maligned area is now home to one of the most up-and-coming strips in East London. Previously more synonymous with fly-tipping, Tilbury Road railway arches (a narrow alleyway opposite Leyton Midland Road station) has been transformed by new arrivals in the last year alone, including three bars, a bakery, a Caribbean restaurant and two soon-to-open artisan cafes. The opening of two popular microbreweries in the last few years on the same stretch sparked this sudden transformation:Gravity Well, nestled in the station arch itself, and the edgierLibertaliataproom, named after a mythical anarchist colony in the 17th Century.\nFor Leyton-raised Danny Saunders, owner of tropical cocktail barLeyton Calling(which opened in summer 2024) and cosy candlelit pubChop Shop Tavern(which opened in February 2025), it's a personal coup, having known the area since the 1980s. \"I've come full circle,\" he said, with a smile. \"My latest bar is in the actual arch where I set up my first car repair business back in the day.\"\nLeyton's rise as a whole has, however, been something of a slow-burn. Back in the mid-2010s, nearby Francis Road began to be taken over by independent creative businesses. \"I opened here in 2017,\" said Aimée Madill, who ownsPhlox, a bookstore, cafe and wine bar. \"It was risky as it was still a 'less-developed' part of London, but local indie bookshops are more than a business, they're a sign of confidence in a community.\"\nPedestrianised in 2017, the tree-lined street has since blossomed with chic cafes and bars: two of the latest openings are vinyl store-cum-craft beer barDreamhouse RecordsandLoop Dining, a pop-up space launched in summer 2024 to host weekly residencies from buzzy up-and-coming chefs.\n\"Unlike Stratford,\" Madill said, \"Leyton is characterised by small makers and creatives existing side by side with businesses who've been here decades. Most of us live here, so we've been able to revitalise, rather than reinvent, parts of the area – which adds to the sense of community.\"\nSo what's next for outer East London? \"Young people and families are now priced out of Hackney,\" said Michaela Zelenanska, who runs natural wine barSwirl, which opened in December 2024 on Tilbury Road. \"Leyton and neighbouring Leytonstone seem a logical next big thing. It's small businesses that make the place what it is.\"\nWill London continue to move ever further east? \"We're already engaging with artists, audiences and community groups in Barking and Dagenham,\" said Morton, referencing two outer London suburbs several miles from Leyton and Stratford.\"East London has always been a creative crucible.\"\nStephen Emms is an East London resident who writes a weekly newsletter calledLeytonstonerabout the arts, food and drink scenes primarily in Leyton, Leytonstone, Stratford and Walthamstow.

    "title": "From Chicago to Châteauneuf-du-Pape: What does a pope's hometown reveal?",
    "content": "From Polish pilgrimage trails to French vineyards, the places popes come from often gain new meaning. With the announcement of the first American pope, could Chicago be next?\nWhen plumes of white smoke billowed across Rome's skyline last week, signifying the election of a new pope, the entire world looked towards Vatican City. But the story of the Catholic Church's new leader began far from St Peter's Square. In a historic first, the papacy now belongs to an American.\nPope Leo XIV– born 4,800 miles away inSouth Side Chicago– took to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica on 8 May to address a frenzied crowd of more than 40,000 people.\n\"The pilgrims in the square went wild,\" said Dr Miles Pattenden, an Oxford University lecturer and expert on the Catholic Church. \"There was a lot of excitement but also gasps of surprise because a lot of people weren't expecting this name. The idea of an American pope has seemed pretty remote for most of the last half of the century. So, there was a sense of shock.\"\nPope Leo's first words to onlookers were not in English, however. He chose instead to speak in a mix of Italian and Spanish – the latter nodding to his 20+ year career in Peru – suggesting his identity spans more than one nation.\nIt begs the question: how does a pope's hometown shape his leadership – and how are those hometowns changed in return?\n\"There can't not be [a connection between pope and place],\" said Nick Spencer, a senior fellow atTheos Think Tank. \"However Catholic-with-a-small-'c' the church is, popes are from certain places and formed by certain experiences.\"\nThat was most obviously the case with Wadowice-born Pope John Paul II, says Spencer. \"It’s inconceivable to think of his papacy without recognising his Polish upbringing and his life under two different totalitarian dictatorships in Poland.\"\nA small town south of Krakow, Wadowice was once a quiet, multicultural Galician backwater. But since the elevation of its most famous son – the first non-Italian pope in 455 years, who served from 1978-2005 – it has transformed into a hub of Catholic pilgrimage.\n\"In the late '70s, Poland was already a pretty Catholic place, but the fact they had a Polish pope absolutely ignited it,\" Spencer said, explaining the impact of the papacy on Pope John II's hometown.\nToday, visitors flock to the modest family home where he was born (which has been turned into amuseum), as well as the parish church where he served as an altar boy and the square where he once played as a child.\nBetween 1996 and 2019, the number of international tourists to the museum more than doubled,according to Studies of the Industrial Geography Commission of the Polish Geographical Society, with a notable peak in 2005, the year of John Paul II's death. And in 2018, the museum celebrated its millionth visitor.\nThis speaks to the pull of a place, says Pattenden. \"Pilgrimage is significant and important for Catholics. Partly because they believe in the enchantment of physical objects, including, for instance, the bodies and the remains of saints, and the items that the saints have touched. That's why you would go back to the birthplace of a saint because you can get grace from your proximity to those things.\"\nYet not all papal hometowns are drawn into the fold. Despite serving as Archbishop of Buenos Aires for more than a decade, Pope Francis, who died this April, travelled across numerous continents, visiting 68 countries during his 12-year papacy – but never returned to Argentina.\nWhether a gesture of neutrality amid the country's fraught politics or a quiet declaration of global focus, his absence was noteworthy. In contrast to the pilgrimage energy that surrounds places like Wadowice, Francis's hometown remains, for now, a site of origin rather than worship.\nStill, his Argentine roots shaped the way he was perceived. Francis became known as the \"people's pope\", something that came from his simple lifestyle, his work in the slums of Buenos Aires and his ease with ordinary people. His background helped reinforce a public image of humility, accessibility and concern for the working class.\nJohn Paul II's Polish birthplace also had a big impact on his world view. He grew up and ministered under two oppressive regimes: first Nazi occupation, then Soviet-backed Communist rule. His papacy was defined by a commitment to human rights, religious freedom and moral resistance and he became a powerful voice against totalitarianism. During a landmark visit to Poland in 1979, his call to \"be not afraid\" resonated deeply with his countrymen, helping to inspire the Solidarity movement that would ultimately contribute to the collapse of Communist rule.\nWhile Wadowice turned piety into pilgrimage, other papal places bear more unusual legacies. In Châteauneuf-du-Pape, a village nestled in the vineyards of southern France, traces of the medieval papacy live on in the local wine.\nIn the early 14th Century, the papacy temporarily relocated from Rome to Avignon in southern France, marking a significant shift in the Church's history. From 1309 to 1377, seven successive French popes resided in the city, escaping political instability in Rome and drawn by the influence of the French crown.\nOften referred to as the \"Avignon Papacy\", this period saw the papal court flourish in grandeur, with its legacy still visible in itsPalais des Papes, a Gothic fortress that once housed the spiritual heart of Catholicism. However, it also sparked controversy, with critics accusing it of corruption and excessive French sway.\nOne pope, John XXII (from Cahors in southern France), commissioned a new summer residence in a nearby village – today known as Châteauneuf-du-Pape, or \"The Pope's New Castle\". His castle served as a fortified retreat and vineyard estate, taking advantage of the region's elevated position and favourable grape-growing conditions. The wine produced herestill bears the papal crestof crossed keys of St Peter and a tiara, and tourists can join tours that blend this medieval papal history with wine tastings trips to centuries-old vineyards.\nWith the recent ascent of Leo XIV, attention has turned to his Chicago roots. In true US fashion, even his sporting allegiances made headlines, sparking debate over whether he supported the Cubs or the White Sox (it's the White Sox, his brother confirmed). But experts say his path may diverge from traditional expectations.\nMore like this:\n•The country that’s famous for tolerance\n•The great conclave secret: What do would-be popes eat?\n•Testaccio: The foodie neighbourhood where Romans go to eat\n\"He is American but he [was] based in Latin America for most of [his life],\" said Pattenden. \"And he quite notably didn’t speak English when he did his initial greeting. That's all a sign to me that he's distancing himself from his Americanness.\"\nSpencer added: \"In addition to being an American pope, Leo's a Peruvian pope in a very profound way so that internationalism, one would imagine, is quite deep in the bone with him and it will be interesting to see if that has an effect.\"\nWhether Chicago will embrace this moment remains to be seen. Its urban parishes and immigrant congregations may well lean into a newfound spiritual spotlight. Pilgrims may one day walk the streets of South Side as they now do in Wadowice. Or perhaps, like Francis's Buenos Aires, it will remain a quiet point of origin that's respected but not venerated.\nWhat is clear is that the connection between papacy and place can linger long after the white smoke clears. It becomes a lens through which a pope's legacy is interpreted and reimagined. From wine labels in southern France to school trips in Poland, these places are transformed by proximity to power, by the long shadow of the papal office and by the faithful who come looking for something more than just a birthplace.

    "title": "Capri has two faces – here's the one you've never seen",
    "content": "The Italian island immediately conjures up grand bougainvillea-draped villas and a whitewashed city centre, lined by luxury boutiques. But that's – literally – only half of the story.\n\"Bring water,\" they said when I announced I'd be hiking theSentiero dei Fortini(Trail of Little Forts). \"There'snothingout there.\"\nThe six-kilometre cliffside path linking the remains of three 19th-Century Bourbon military outposts was my fourth hike on this craggy Mediterranean island. Somewhere along the rocky, wild rosemary-flocked path while dodging spiky prickly pears, I realised that I'd only seen one other human in two hours. And there were indeed no water sources, aside from a rustic fountain I'd encountered a kilometre back at Fort Mèsola.\nMy Google Maps sputtered. I'd already got lost twice before noting that the ceramic path markers were low to the ground, cataloguing the area's flora and fauna – fig trees and wildflowers, wall lizards and falcons. The terrain faded from wilderness to sheer crags. Finally at the last fort, Fort Orrico, I could see straight down to the sea; a 30m death drop. The islands of Ischia and Procida loomed in the Gulf of Naples like the humps of petrified sea monsters. And I was completely alone at the island's edge; triumphant.\nThis is Capri. But perhaps not as you imagine it.\nTypically, the word Capri conjures up bougainvillea-draped villas and luxury boutique-lined streets; a yacht dock for the glitterati and the perpetual artists' muse. Paul Feig'sAnother Simple Favor, which premiered on 1 May on Prime Video, is the latest film set against the island's opulent hotel culture and majestic cliffs, and is sure to inspire a fresh slew of Capri travel dreams.\nBut in Capri, glamour is – literally – only half of the story.\nThe camel-humped Capri – one of Italy's threevolcanic Phlegrean islands– is actually home to two distinct towns. At the eastern end lies the princess Capri Town where loafer-wearing VIPs sip espresso in Piazza Umberto I; thefaraglionisea stacks winking in the distance. And at Capri's western end is her rugged little sister, the township of Anacapri; a sea cliff and prickly pear paradise where hiking boots replace stilettos and wild outdoorsy adventures trump wild nightlife.\nBut while Capri seesas many as 16,000 visitorsa day – outnumbering the 12,900 full-time residents – the majority only visit Capri Town.\n\"There's two main reasons for this,\" surmises Camilla Formisano, copyeditor atCapri.com. \"Time and imagination. Seventy to 80% of visitors arrive on organised excursions from Naples, Sorrento or cruise ships. So they visit the most famous, easily accessible places from the port, like Piazza Umberto I.\"\nFormisano also believes that social media plays a part: \"People see the faraglioni and the piazza and think, 'I saw Capri'. Social media has condensed the island into a single postcard.\"\nSocial media is merely Capri Town's latest PR rep. Before becoming a premier Italian bucket list destination, Capri was a humble fishing island. It was settled by the Ancient Greeks, later becoming the seaside retreat of the Roman emperor Tiberius, who leftgrand villasin his wake. It wasn't until centuries later, when the Romantic poets and then Hollywood filmmakers turned their artistic eye on Capri Town, that it becamea VIP haven. Today, visitors spill out from the ferry and throng the bus and funicular ticket booths to jockey for place in Piazza Umberto I, dodging motorised luggage carts and women in Instagrammable sundresses at every turn.\nMeanwhile, it's just a 15-minute bus ride to Anacapri, where respite from Capri Town's day-tripper crowds and inflated prices await.\n\"Anacapri isn't completely free of overtourism,\" admits Formisano, referencing the tourist crush at theBlue Grotto,Villa San Micheleand the chairlift toMonte Solaro. \"But head west, through the Boffe [main] quarter towards the lighthouse and theMigliera[trail], and you'll find the island's heart.\"\nAnacapri is crisscrossed by stone-walled paths that yield to sudden sea views; perfumed in springtime by blooming orange trees. The terrain is hilly; locals zip by me on scooters and dusty motorised three-wheeled buggies. One wrong turn and I find myself either wheezing up a steep incline or at the cliff's edge.\nDespite the divine aimlessness of wandering Anacapri on foot, its principal outdoor attractions are best reached with wheels. TheATC Capri Srlbuses operate regularly between Piazza Vittoria, the Blue Grotto andPunta Carena, a craggy bay dominated by the island's rust-red19th-Century lighthouse, where sunbathers splay themselves on the rocks or dive nose-first into the sea. Beach clubs are cut into the cliffs, the most beloved beingda Antonio, a shack serving panini, gelato and an excellent crouton-and-auberginepanzanellasalad. The upscaleLido del Farofeatures a pool and a full-service restaurant; I enjoy a bracing limoncello Spritz while watching the wild swimmers from above.\nBut Punta Carena is best known for its sunsets.\n\"It's the only place on Capri where the sun sets into the sea,\" says Formisano. \"Thanks to Capri's particular shape, Anacapri remains sun-kissed until sunset. Sunsets here are a special experience, casting a golden light that envelops the landscape.\"\nIt was Formisano who first directed me to the Trail of Little Forts. \"A must-see,\" she called it.\nThe medium-difficulty trail runs along Anacapri's western coast between the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena. It's possible to start the trail at either end, but most trekkers begin at the Blue Grotto.\n\"So you can walk calmly immersed in nature, have a swim in Mèsola cove and get to the lighthouse by afternoon; just in time to enjoy an aperitif and the magnificent spectacle of the sunset over the sea,\" says Formisano.\nBack in the Boffe quarter, Piazza della Pace is the origin point for two other brilliant Anacapri hikes; the Migliera trail and Mount Solaro.\n\"The Migliera is a narrow road winding through the countryside,\" says Formisano. \"You'll come to a dramatic cliff overlook. Climb the ridge to the left; you'll get a really unique view of the faraglioni.\"\nHowever, the view from Mount Solaro – Capri's highest point – is arguably the island's most famous. The 13-minute chairlift up the 589m mountain provides unforgettable views of terraced vineyards with the Amalfi Coast winking in the distance.\nVertigo? Summit Mount Solaro on foot by following Via Axel Munthe to Via Salita per il Solaro, keeping an eye out for stray mountain goats.\nFor any Anacapri hike, wear trail shoes; not your new Capri leather sandals. Before setting off, \"stop atDe Martinoin Piazza Capri for an excellent panino\", advises Formisano.\nMost people reach Anacapri by bus, but if you're fit, consider tackling the 1.7kmScala Fenicia, a 921-step flight of stone stairs chiselled into the cliffs by the Ancient Greeks; allowing countless generations of hardy Capresi to travel between Capri and Anacapri.\n\"It's not for everyone,\" admits Pep Minichino, founder of the Gulf of Naples-based blog,Campanica. Nonetheless, he encourages visitors to \"embrace the experience! All you need is a Led Zeppelin anthem [in your head] for the energy to climb the famous zig-zag staircase.\"\nThe Scala Fenicia, which can be accessed from Marina Grande, leads straight up to Villa San Michele, the residence of the early 20th-Century Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe. The sprawling mansion – built over Roman ruins, featuring grand sitting rooms and Neoclassical gardens – is Anacapri's most touristed museum. But I came to climb, and my heart rate thunders as I bypass the tourist hordes at Marina Grande to undertake the trek, surrounded by olive trees, terraced lemon groves and, finally at the top, the sea.\n\"La Scala Fenicia is also open at night, so you can go down step by step,\" says Minichino. \"Slowly. Aided in your descent by a cascade of lights and stars.\"\nBy far, Anacapri's most visited attraction is the Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra), famed for its magical blue phosphorescence. Chaotic overtourism has engulfed this natural phenomenon, and I am overwhelmed by the massive queue and dozens of tourist-packed boats bobbing outside the grotto. But, once inside, the azure-blue light is breathtaking, and I am comforted as the boat captain's serenade of O Sole Mio echoes through the cave.\nFormisano's hack: \"The best way to visit the Blue Grotto is to be on the entrance steps at 09:00, arriving by land from Anacapri, not by sea from Marina Grande,\" she says. \"This way you'll be first in line. You won't have to wait your turn on a rocking boat.\"\nBut to truly enjoy the seas of Anacapri, Formisano suggests doing as the Capresi do: \"Going down to the Blue Grotto, follow the signs for \"gradola\" to reach a small terrace overlooking the sea with an excellent restaurant, a place frequented almost exclusively by locals.\"\nMinichino agrees: \"The best swimming, diving and sunbathing in Anacapri.\"\n\"After a day of outdoor activities in Anacapri, the best way to relax is to immerse yourself in the town's authentic, peaceful atmosphere,\" says Formisano.\nMy B&B,Giardino dell'Arte, is no sumptuous 19th-Century Capri Town palazzo, but my tidy room is floored with blue and white ceramic tiles, and orange blossoms spill over the wooden door. The courtyard overlooks a garden and the innkeeper offers me homemaderavioli alla Caprese; round ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs.\nStrolling deeper into the Boffe quarter, I come uponLa Casa Rossa, a bright red mansion built by the American colonel John Clay MacKowen in the early 20th Century; a quirky blend of architectural styles ranging from medieval to Middle Eastern. There are generational bakeries in leaf-shaded alleys where I buy fistfuls of sour cherry pastries andpizzette.\nBut the neighbourhood stunner is theChiesa Monumentale di San Michele Arcangelo, a petite Baroque church with a show-stopping majolica floor in ochres and blues depicting the Fall of Eden. The tiles can only be viewed from strategically positioned wooden boards or from the balcony above. Wide-mouthed crocodiles, lions and hooved Biblical beasts leer up at me, Adam and Eve at the centre of the fray.\nIt's my favourite island view… until the rooftops.\nBecause Anacapri is still Capri, just off the Boffe quarter there are two opulent hotels;Jumeirah Capri Palaceand the historicHotel Caesar Augustus, a palatial structure dating to 1850 whose clifftop terrace seems to extend into the sea. I charm my way into both, and wind up on their rooftop bars as the sun sinks pink and purple into the Gulf of Naples, throwing Ischia and Procida into bas relief. Another limoncello Spritz, and I sink into a luxurious armchair, crossing my dusty ankles in their hiking boots; princess and athlete all at once. "

    "title": "'It's just not worth it': The US travellers afraid to travel abroad right now",
    "content": "Declining trust in airline safety, a rise in US citizens being detained when reentering the country and growing anti-American sentiment abroad have some rethinking their summer travels.\nTravelling abroad used to barely faze Mary S. The American marketing professional estimates she would cross the border twice a year from her southern Arizona home to visit Los Algodones, Mexico nearby. She was also planning on attending a conference this summer in Canada to escape the Southwest US's sweltering heat. But after watching thesweeping new policiesenacted by US President Donald Trump over the last three months and a notable rise inUS citizensandpermanent residentsbeingdetainedwhen attempting to re-enter the country, she's having second thoughts.\n\"There's no way I'm going anywhere near an airport or border crossing,\" she said.\nWhile Mary said that some of her trepidation is about the recent spate ofair control tower staffing issuesandnear-misses, she's more worried about potential retaliation from her social media posts criticising the Trump administration, and is afraid of being harassed at border crossings. (She requested we not use her full name for the same reasons.)\nThese worries might have once seemed outlandish, but last week Twitch streamer Hasan Piker – who is known for his criticism of Trump and his pro-Gaza policies – wasreportedly detained for hoursby federal agents at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after returning from France. Though eventually released, Piker said he was questioned about his views on the Middle East in an interrogation room andasked\"Do you like Donald Trump?\"\nIn response, Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security posted astatement on social mediasaying that the interaction was \"a routine, lawful process that occurs daily, and can apply for any traveler\".\nOther high-profile incidents involvingthe detention of US citizenshave some people \"freaked out\" by the idea of international travel. Pair that withmany Americans losing faith in air travel safetyfollowing a spate of recent airplane crashes andanti-American sentiment risingin Europe andCanada, and some Americans are putting their international travel plans on hold – if not outright cancelling their trips.\nWhile she says the majority of her clients continue to book and take trips as usual, travel advisor Tamara Lidbom ofAnytime Travel Agencyhas seen some changes. \"Lawful permanent residents who are worried they will not be allowed to re-enter the United States based on changing immigration enforcement are just cancelling trips,\" she said. \"They have decided it is safer to vacation in the United States and avoid the potential risks associated with leaving the country and attempting to re-enter.\"\nBoutique tour operatorJayWay Travelhas also seen a noticeable slowdown in demand from American travellers compared to last year, but the decline isn't only about flight safety or detention fears. \"Economic uncertainty and the declining US dollar [which hit athree-year low against the eurolast month following Trump's tariff rollout] are definitely factors,\" says Charlie Neville, the company's marketing director.\nStill, airplane safety is top of mind for many travellers, as Newark Airport in New Jersey, in particular, has faced mounting problems. Last week, the airportexperienced its third system outagein less than two weeks, leaving controllers unable to communicate with pilots for up to 30 seconds, and reports continue to flood in that the control room is severely understaffed. Though the airport has a target of 14 controllers,only three were monitoring airspacelast Monday.\nDespite recent headlines, air travel in the US continues to be one of the safest modes of transportation.National Transportation Safety Board datashows fatal aviation accidents in 2025 to be below the three-year average for the same period. Yet, conversations about aviation safety have been widely covered in US media, adding to the perceived threat. According to news and intelligence agencyStoryful, aviation incident discussions on social media have skyrocketed, up 243% on X accounts based in the US and 71% on Reddit compared to early 2024. That has also translated to more posts about flying anxiety, up 72% on X accounts based in the US and 22% on Reddit compared to early 2024.\nMore like this:\n•How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n•'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\n•The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\"Safety in travel has become a daily conversation lately, as a travel advisor specialising in European travel and a wife to a commercial airline pilot,\" said Sarah Magnoni, owner ofHarmony Travel Collective. \"Nearly all of my clients have inquired about safety. In 2024, I received virtually no questions on airline safety.\" While Magnoni has advised her clients to avoid Newark airport in the near future if possible to avoid delays and cancellations, overall she feels confident about airline safety.\n\"Commercial airline pilots aren't striking or refusing to fly at this time. That tells us everything we need to know about aviation safety right now,\" she said.\nAndrew Coggins, a clinical professor of management at Pace University in New York who specialises in the travel industry, also thinks Americans won't necessarily skip out on flights due to safety, even if they end up routing domestically versus internationally. \"The FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] woes are discounted by Americans booking flights since [US travellers don't] have much choice outside ofAmtrak's Northeast Corridorif one wants to get somewhere fast,\" he said. \"Newark's woes will have a greater effect on future bookings than near-term reservations, since changing airports/flights might involve considerable additional expense.\"\nCoggins recently booked a flight to the UK, and was surprised that the flight was completely full. Even though he's been flying to the UK since 1969,the country's new visa requirementcame as a shock (even though he said it was easy to do online). Many frequent US travellers also complained that changing visa requirements in foreign countries are causing them to reconsider international trips in an already anxious summer travel season.\nFor Magnoni, more of her American clients are also inquiring about how they may be perceived abroad in light of more nations issuing travel warnings to the US andgreater calls to boycott travel to the US. For the countries she specialises in – Ireland and Scotland – Magnoni says Americans should have no problems at all. \"They're very welcoming to Americans and take pride in showcasing their countries, histories and cultures,\" she said. \"Their tourism boards are very welcoming and ready for American travellers.\"\nIn fact, those looking for a bargain may do well to keep their European holiday plans this summer. \"This may be one of the best times in years to visit Europe: fewer crowds, more availability and great airfare deals – especially out of European cities,\" said Neville. \"Other than in Rome, we're expecting significantly lighter crowds across Europe this summer. While we're not seeing mass cancellations, we are noticing fewer inquiries and more indecisiveness. It feels a lot like summer 2022, when international travel was just starting to rebound.\"\nCoggins still expects a busy summer travel season, but since it's just the start of the season, the tales of border crossing woes may just be beginning. That said, he still believes the greatest impact of changing policies and border crossing fears will impact international visitors here, rather than Americans going abroad. \"I think the tales of tourists' encounters with Homeland Security may have a greater effect on summer inbound tourism than Americans' worries over FAA safety or border crossing,\" he said.\nSo far, that belief is backed up by the data. According to theUS International Trade Administration, overnight visitors from Western Europe declined by 17% in March 2025 compared to the same time last year. Overall foreign arrivals were down 12% – the sharpest dip since the pandemic recovery began, according to JayWay. Perhaps most telling: according to a report published last week by theWorld Travel & Tourism Council(WTTC), the US is on track to lose $12.5bn (£9.4bn) in international travel spending this year.\n\"This is a wake-up call for the US government,\" the WTTC's President and CEO Julia Simpson said in the report. \"The world's biggest travel and tourism economy is heading in the wrong direction, not because of a lack of demand, but because of a failure to act. While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the US government is putting up the 'closed' sign.\"\nSkift's recent reserach report,The Trump Effect: Skift Travel Health Index Market Analysis, quantified the lag further. The report found that overall travel dipped 2% in March, particularly from Canada, where flight bookings fell 22% and hotel bookings dropped 34% following a spike in bilateral tensions. France, Italy, Mexico and Brazil are also seeing declines.\nAmericans staying home this summer may provide a buffer to the travel and tourism sector. Skift's report found that US domestic travel activity has remained nearly flat year-on-year. The report theorises that the weakening dollar may also keep Americans at home, with an uptick in particular to drive-to destinations.\nMany US destinations are taking note.Vail, Colorado, one of the US's most popular ski resorts and home to a Tyrolean-style village, is currently marketing itself as providing the charm of a European holiday without visitors having to fly across the pond. It's also promoting its support for public lands even among federal budget and staffing cuts. Jesse Neugarten, founder and CEO ofDollar Flight Club, suggests dupes like Santa Fe, New Mexico as a stateside stand-in for Spain; Sedona, Arizona for Morocco; and the Florida Keys instead of international beach vacations. \"These destinations offer similar vibes without the long-haul flights or price tags,\" he said.\nAccording to Alex Alioto, head of growth at vacation rental firmWhimstay, many US travellers seem keen to stay in the US this summer and explore destinations relatively close to home. \"We've been seeing a lot of inner-state bookings in the US, so people from California travelling within California, Texans traveling within Texas. Not only is domestic travel leading over international, but people aren't venturing outside of state lines.\"\nOne such person is American traveller Emily Dreilich. Though she had her heart set on travelling to Bolivia this summer, she decided to cancel and remain stateside.\n\"The combination of increased reports of flight disruptions, border control unpredictability and just this general tension in the air right now is what really made me stop and rethink,\" Dreilich said. \"When that anxiety gets high enough to mess with your trip from day one, it's just not worth it, especially if your vacation is short. When you only get one trip a year, you're not being paranoid for wanting a smooth entry and exit.\" "

    "title": "Monaco's new €2bn neighbourhood rising out of the sea",
    "content": "Built on reclaimed land, Monaco's new Mareterra district blends cutting-edge sustainability with scenic sea views, offering a fresh way to explore the principality.\nIt was just past noon inMareterra, Monaco's newest neighbourhood, and a crowd swelled on the terrace outsideMarlow,the principality's first British fine-dining restaurant. Nearby, office workers stretched out on wide steps by the water for their lunch break. Promenade Prince Jacques, the 800m pedestrian walkway that sweeps around the sea-facing perimeter of Mareterra, was busy with parents pushing strollers and joggers pounding the concrete pavement. I paused to soak up the view across the expanse of blue sea towards the leafy Roquebrune-Cap-Martin headland and Italy beyond. The area blended so seamlessly with the surrounding landscape that I struggled to remember how, six months ago, this was still an unfinished construction site – and that eight years ago, where I stood was the Mediterranean Sea.\nThis reclaimed district, a €2bn project unveiled in December 2024, is Monaco's latest answer to a question it has faced for more than 150 years: how do you expand when you've already run out of land?\nI walked along the promenade and ducked through a door along the path, entering a dark, concrete antechamber. Another door led through to the hollowed interior of one of 18 caissons, the 10,000 ton, 26m-high chambers that sit side by side like giant Lego bricks on the seafloor to create the maritime infrastructure of the new neighbourhood.\nIn the dark, unlit space, it took a while for my eyes to catch up to what my ears immediately recognised: waves, crashing against a wall then flopping back onto the water's surface. I peered over a thick railing separating me from the drop into the sea below. The Mediterranean surged up as if reaching for my attention, while the reinforced concrete chamber remained silent and immobile as it soaked up the impact of the swell.\nThe top of the upper section of each caisson, which is known as the Jarlan chamber, is above the waterline to allow water to flow in and out through thin, vertical openings on the outward-facing side. The design has been engineered to act as a breakwater to absorb and disperse the energy of the waves.\n\"That means, even during 100-year storms, they won't rise too high nor submerge [Mareterra],\" said Guy Thomas Levy-Soussan, the managing director of SAM L'Anse du Portier, the developers of Mareterra, as we stood in La Grotte Bleue, as this space is called, named after the Blue Grotto of Capri. \"When the Sun shines through the openings in the Jarlan chamber in the morning, there's a slightly blue hue to the space,\" he said, explaining the choice of name.\nLa Grotte Bleue doesn't sparkle under the weight of four walls adorned in pastel pink and lavender purple quartz likeits Instagram-pretty neighboura couple of doors down, a meditation room for quiet contemplationdesigned by Vietnamese artist Tia-Thủy Nguyễn. And I probably would feel a little uneasy being in the dark space alone. Yet it has quickly become one of the Mediterranean principality's most unusual, and least glossy, landmarks, attracting a steady flow of people like me, curious for a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the technical ingenuity involved in reclaiming land from the sea.\nLand reclamation is nothing new in Monaco, the world's second-smallest country after the Vatican City, where 38,000 residents cram into a territory just more than 22sq km in size. While a high proportion of that figure are millionaires, they're still living in the mostdensely populated country in the world.\nHemmed in by France, Monaco's default solution to its space issue is to extend out into the water. Since 1907, 25% of Monaco's territory has been reclaimed, including the principality's beachfront,Larvotto, the superyacht-lined Port Hercules and theFontvieilledistrict to the west of the Prince's Palace of Monaco.\nIf Prince Rainier III, who came to power in 1949, carved out a reputation as \"the builder prince\", his son and current sovereign, Prince Albert II, is continuing the tradition. It was in 2013 when he announced plans to reclaim these six hectares just off the coast near Larvotto at Monaco's eastern extent, later naming it Mareterra to reflect its connection to the sea and the land. The neighbourhood has increased the principality's territory by 3% and comprises two residential apartment blocks (including one designed by celebrated Italian architectRenzo Piano), 10 villas and four townhouses, a small marina, 14 commercial spaces and three hectares of public space.\nMareterra fits like the missing piece of a puzzle into this stretch of Monaco's coastline. It is latched alongside theGrimaldi Forum, an event space that often hosts travelling art exhibitions and stage shows, and theJapanese Garden, planted in 1994 with Mediterranean pines, pomegranate and olive trees in accordance with Zen design principles. Both sites have been able to grow in size thanks to the extension.\nIn line with the Prince's commitment to make the principality carbon neutral by 2050, Mareterra has also been imagined as Monaco's greenest corner. Nine thousand square metres of solar panels, 200 EV charging stations and 800 trees are among the eco-friendly initiatives in the district.\nJust inside the entrance to La Grotte Bleue, a five-minute longvideoplays on a loop, an introduction to how the project addressed the inevitable marine disruption that comes with such construction. The caissons hold a key role here, as well; reliefs and grooves were moulded into their construction to encourage marine flora and fauna colonisation. Segments were even sanded by hand to add texture. The Jarlan chambers have an additional bonus, recreating shallow areas where fish can dart in and out.\nThe most delicate of challenges, however, involved transplanting 384sq m ofPosidonia oceanica, an endemic seagrass that playsa critical rolein the Mediterranean ecosystem and is protected by EU legislation. Apioneering techniqueused a modified tree spade to scoop Posidonia sods into baskets which could then be replanted 200m away in theLarvotto Marine Protected Area. \"Usually we transport Posidonia plants one by one,\" explained Sylvie Gobert, an oceanologist at the University of Liège in Belgium who worked on the project. \"What is ultimately innovative is that we took the Posidonia, along with its entire root ecosystem and about a cubic metre of sediment.\"\nMore like this:\n•Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n•8 ways to travel more sustainably in 2025\n•Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\nIf the Posidonia has ultimately settled into its new home, so has Monaco into Mareterra. As I surveyed the area, I realised how quickly the soft blues and greys of Le Renzo, Piano's striking residential block that stands sentinel over the neighbourhood, has become a familiar part of the local landscape. Nearby,Quatre Lances, a sculpture by American artist Alexander Calder that was purchased by Prince Albert's mother, Grace Kelly, in the 1960s and had been languishing in storage, has become a meeting point where people gravitate. A small nature walk, La Pinède, winds through a rocky garden planted with Aleppo and umbrella pines, the same species you would find if you were hiking through the Provence countryside. A water source gently trickled past birds' nests and insect hotels installed amid the Mediterranean shrub. These aren't the glossy attractions that Monaco is renowned for, like the gildedCasino de Monte-Carlo. It's an area that has been designed for locals, with only a handful of shops and restaurants, although visitors come to enjoy the peaceful gardens, sea views and the ingenuity of how Mareterra came to be.\nDespite its ecological ambitions, Mareterra raises questions about necessity. Though billed as Monaco's answer to its housing challenges, property prices are speculated to start from €100,000 per square metre, making it some of the most expensive real estate in the world. Plus, none of the new residences have been reserved for Monegasques, who number nearly 10,000 and have a right to subsidised housing.\nHowever, those in Monaco are sure that Mareterra isn't the end of its growth story. \"For Prince Albert, if there isn't construction, the country is at a standstill,\" said Nancy Heslin, co-founder ofCarob Tree Publishing, Monaco's first all-female publishing house, who has interviewed the Prince on various occasions. \"The country will always seek to continue to expand its territory.\"\n\"As long as it [has] the desire – and budget – to push the boundaries of what is possible on both a technological and ecological scale, the principality will be an example for other coastal cities to follow. As a laboratory for this kind of innovation,\" said Levy-Soussan, \"Monaco is a small country that has done extraordinary things.\" "

    "title": "What does the UK-EU deal mean for holidays and jobs? Your questions answered",
    "content": "Many of you have been submitting questions to Your Voice, Your BBC News about the deal signed this week between the UK and European Union.\nYour questions have touched on a range of issues, including jobs, food and travel.\nOur experts have been digging into the detail to figure out what the deal means for you and your family.\nAnna Maria, a dental student studying in Bulgaria, asked about mutual recognition of professional qualifications, which was a Labour Party manifesto pledge. Our political reporter Becky Morton has looked into the details of the deal.\nIn its manifesto last year, Labour said it would seek to \"secure a mutual recognition agreement for professional qualifications, external to help open up markets for UK service exporters\".\nThat would mean professionals such as doctors, lawyers and accountants who qualified in one country could practice in another with minimal extra bureaucracy - a system already in place across the EU.\nMonday's deal promises to set up \"dedicated dialogues\" on the recognition of professional qualifications, but a full agreement could take much longer to negotiate.\nSuch an agreement would make it easier for British companies to move staff between the UK and EU and undertake short-term work in Europe.\nHowever, there may be less incentive for the EU to agree a deal, given the current situation makes it harder for UK firms to compete for business in Europe.\nMalcolm in Bristol wanted more clarity on what the agreement will mean for passport queues for UK citizens visiting the EU. Our transport correspondent Simon Browning explains.\nWhile some EU ports and airports already allow UK citizens to use modern e-gates, many do not and queues have become familiar to holidaymakers.\nThe new agreement provides more clarity on e-gates and sets out that in the future, UK citizens will be able to use them - but the EU Commission says that will not come into force in time for this summer.\nHowever, the UK government has indicated it is hopeful there could be changes in time for the summer, so the timeline still appears to be up for debate.\nThe EU says there will be no change before a new EU border security scheme comes into force in October, which will see biometric data including fingerprints collected from passengers coming from non-EU countries such as the UK.\nIt will mean manned desks where people will have to queue in order to enter some EU countries could still be a feature of travel beyond this year, even if e-gate usage becomes more widely available.\nIn short, that will mean long queues at some destinations could continue during this holiday season and perhaps beyond.\nAny decision about UK citizens using e-gates will not be a blanket one across the bloc. Instead, it will be up to individual countries to decide how they manage queues at their borders.\nWe have received a lot of questions about pet passports. Our political correspondent Jack Fenwick has looked into when the scheme will be up and running.\nIn short, we just do not know yet whether there will be any change in time for this summer.\nThe agreement between the UK and EU commits to introducing a new passport system which would make it easier for people to travel with their pets and end the need to acquire repeat vet certificates.\nMany British holidaymakers will be keen for these rules to be introduced in time for their trip this year.\nHowever, so-called pet passports come under a part of the deal known as the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement - and while the UK and EU have agreed to work together in this area, the full scope of it has not been fully fleshed out yet.\nChris in Bristol asked whether UK farmers would have to accept EU regulations on food standards. Our business correspondent Simon Jack has assessed the impact.\nThe new agreement removes the need for time consuming and costly veterinary checks and forms - but in return, the UK will have to align with EU food standards.\nAs those regulations change, the UK will have to change too.\nThe government insists it will have a say in how those rules develop and it may be able to negotiate exceptions - but they will not have a vote.\nThe National Farmers Union has broadly welcomed the new deal because it provides easier and quicker access to a big market for perishable products, in which the speed that goods can be moved is important.\nAndy in Eastbourne asked whether this deal would allow for the free and unrestricted movement of musicians and bands on tour in Europe. Our political reporter Becky Morton answered.\nSince Brexit, British musicians have faced extra costs and red tape when touring Europe.\nThe industry has been urging the government to find a solution and Labour's general election manifesto pledged to \"help our touring artists\" as part of negotiations with the EU.\nBut the deal agreed on Monday only recognises the \"value\" of touring artists and promises to continue efforts \"to support travel and cultural exchange\".\nThe UK says it will explore \"how best to improve arrangements for touring across the European continent\".\nTom Kiehl, chief executive of UK Music, which represents the industry, welcomed this as \"an important first step\" but said the sector was seeking \"more concrete commitments\".\nBrian in Nottingham asked about any knock-on effect the agreement may have on the UK's ability to negotiate trade deals with other nations. Political correspondent Jack Fenwick looked into it for him.\nIf the UK was to re-join the customs union or single market, there would be knock-on effects for other trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership - but this relatively limited agreement does not go nearly that far.\nHowever, the UK will now effectively be a rule-taker when it comes to EU standards on food and farming exports - but the government is fairly comfortable with that for two reasons.\nFirstly, ministers do not want to lower food standards anyway, which we saw during recent trade negotiations with the US.\nSecondly, the level of trade the UK has with the EU massively outstrips other agreements signed in recent years.\nThis UK-EU deal is expected to eventually boost the economy by around £9bn a year, largely from food, farming and energy trading. Compare that with the much broader agreement signed with India this year, which will bring economic benefits of around £5bn a year.\nNeil Heard asked whether people who owned properties in the EU before Brexit would be able to spend more time there? Political analyst Peter Barnes checked it out.\nThere was nothing in the new agreement that would change the rules in this respect.\nIf a UK citizen travels to the Schengen area, which covers most of the EU and some other European countries, you do not need a visa but you can only stay for 90 days in any 180 day period.\nThe rule applies even if the 90 days is made up of multiple trips, and also if you stay in more than one Schengen area country. It is the total number of days that counts.\nIreland and Cyprus are not in the Schengen area and UK citizens have the right to live and work in Ireland - but for people with holiday homes in France and other EU countries, the rules are not changing.\nThe Schengen agreement abolished many of Europe's internal borders, allowing freedom of movement between the countries which are signed up to it.\nA reader in Scotland asked about the impact on the local fishing industry. Scotland editor James Cook spelled out what it means for the whole of the UK.\nTo understand what has gone on, we need to go back to when the UK was a member of the EU. Back then, fishing quotas were governed by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) under which EU boats could catch fish in UK waters and vice versa.\nThis was very unpopular with many UK fishermen who complained, accurately, that under the CFP they caught far fewer fish in EU waters than EU fishermen caught in UK waters.\nAfter Brexit, the UK and the EU agreed that EU vessels could still fish in UK waters until 30 June 2026, but that 25% of the EU's quota in UK waters (by value of fish landings) would gradually be transferred to the UK.\nFrom 1 July 2026, EU-UK deals for fishing access were going to be negotiated annually.\nBut this new deal maintains the current position in terms of EU access to UK waters for 12 years, a move criticised by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation as a \"total capitulation\" by the UK government.\nDowning Street stressed that the EU quota in UK waters has not increased, and says the deal provides certainty - as well as streamlining the process for selling UK fish and shellfish in the EU.\n"

    "title": "The 25 best places to travel in 2025",
    "content": "From bubblegum-coloured lakes in Australia to a solar-powered safari camp in Botswana, these are BBC journalists' top destinations this year.\nTravel has the power to connect, inspire and even transform us. Peering over the edge of a crashing waterfall in Newfoundland and ascending sawtooth spires in the Italian Dolomites reveal how wondrous the world can be. But while travel should be a force for good, the past year has reminded us that it also has the potential to overwhelm and even harm the places we love, and many destinations are now imposing new restrictions as they grapple with the negative effects ofovertourism.\nIn the BBC's inaugural guide to the best places to travel this year, we wanted to highlight the destinations experiencing the opposite phenomenon. Each of these 25 spots is not only welcoming visitors and offering incredible travel experiences, but also using tourism to support local communities, protect the environment or preserve their unique cultural heritage. We compiled the list with input from BBC Travel journalists and some of the world's leading sustainable travel authorities, such as theUnited Nations World Travel Organization,Sustainable Travel International, theBlack Travel Allianceand theWorld Travel & Tourism Council.\nAs tourism in many regions soars pastpre-pandemic levels, and extreme weather and climate change reveal the fragile impermanence of many bucket-list destinations, travelling thoughtfully means considering where your trip can serve a larger good.\nFrom trekking through a moonlike landscape in Bolivia to Arctic glamping in Greenland on the world's largest island, your next great adventure is just ahead.\nEver wanted to swim alongside sperm whales? Dominica now offers the chance to do it in an ethical, sustainable way as part of the Caribbean island's groundbreaking commitment to marine conservation and regenerative tourism. The island nation recently established theworld's first sperm whale reserve, a protected marine area designed to safeguard its resident giants. Limited permits for whale swims ensure intimate, respectful encounters, offering visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience to share the water with these incredible cetaceans while facilitating research and creating sustainable tourism opportunities for local residents.\nNew for 2025, expanded infrastructure and systems are set to welcome visitors, including digital immigration forms to ease arrival and the development of a cable-car system taking riders fromRoseau Valleyup toBoiling Lake, one of the world's largest thermal springs. Access to the island has never been easier: on top of existing American Airlines flights from Miami, United Airlines islaunching direct flightsfrom Newark starting 15 February. Several new hotels are opening in 2025 (adding nearly 500 rooms with a 25% increase in inventory), including the six-star HiltonTranquility Beach Resort and Spain Salisbury. Or choose a tried-and-true classic such asSecret Bay,a luxury eco-property that frequently tops sustainability lists.\nDominica is also home toProject CETI, a groundbreaking international effort todecode whale language, clicks and codas, led by National Geographic Explorer David Gruber. Elsewhere, visitors can explore hidden gorges, towering waterfalls and feast on local cuisine at unique eateries, such as the farm-to-tableLacou. Dominica isn't just a destination – it's a movement to support a burgeoning model of eco-tourism that balances biodiversity conservation with economic growth, ensuring that your adventure helps protect this natural paradise for generations to come. –Pier Nirandara\nHome to one of Yayoi Kusama's iconic yellow, polka-dotted Pumpkin sculptures, the Japanese island ofNaoshimahas become a must-see destination for connoisseurs of contemporary art and architecture. Once known (if at all) for its highly polluting copper smelting industry, the island's transformation is thanks toBenesse Art Site Naoshima, which has helped create major museums and site-specific artworks in the scenically stunning (and dramaticallypopulation-dwindling) Seto Inland Sea, located between Japan's main island of Honshu and Shikoku.\nSpring 2025 sees the opening of theNaoshima New Museum of Art, designed by Tadao Ando, the award-winning architect behind nine other projects on the island. This new showcase for works by Asian artists will be a major highlight of this year'sSetouchi Triennale, with events and unveilings of artwork scattered across 17 islands and coastal areas of the Seto Inland Sea. Scheduled over 100 days and split between spring, summer and autumn to allow visitors to enjoy the region through the different seasons, this is the largest iteration of the Triennale since it began in 2010. The festival and activities of Benesse Art Site Naoshima have been instrumental in turning not only Naoshima's fortunes around but also reviving the neighbouring islands of Teshima and Inujima.\nBook ahead to visit Rei Naito and Ryue Nishizawa'sTeshima Art Museum, a one-of-a-kind synthesis of art, architecture and nature; while on Inujima, travellers will be amazed by the remains of a historic copper refinery reimagined as anepic-scale art installation. Memorable places to stay include Roka, a contemporary-styled ryokan on Naoshima, and the elegantly minimalistEspoir Innon Teshima. –Simon Richmond\nPerpetual fan favourite Italy hardly needs more press – especially in a year when its supremelyovertouristed capital, Rome, will be even more overwhelmed due to the 2025 Jubilee. But if Italy is still on your bucket list for 2025, consider taking a detour north to the Dolomite Mountains.\nFor Italians, the ruggedly beautiful Dolomites are synonymous with family fun and luxury holidays. The stunning sawtooth limestone cliffs sprawl across the regions of Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, attracting vacationing Italians in droves each year for their exquisite villages;peerless \"white week\" skiing; epic hike; and world-class, stick-to-your-ribs Alpine dishes. This classic Italian playground is often overlooked by overseas visitors – but that's all poised to change.\nThe \"Queen of the Dolomites\",Cortina d'Ampezzo, has been slated to co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The preparations, which will take place throughout 2025, include a vast series of infrastructure improvements throughout the area – all against a backdrop of pre-Olympic buzz. Visitors can expect to find expanded ski lift networks in the Dolomiti Superski area, where the towns ofAlta BadiaandVal Gardenawill launch modernised lifts and enhanced connections to public transit operating within the area. New and upgraded cable cars, lifts and gondolas will also be introduced throughout the regions' towns.\nBut the Dolomites is a thrilling destination in all seasons; visit in spring, summer and autumn to enjoy excellent trails, like 2024's newCammino Retico(The Rhaetian Way); a 170km, seven-day trail connecting remote villages between the Veneto and Trentino regions. And for pure relaxation, the luxuryAman Rosa Alpina hotelwill have its grand reopening in 2025. The property will now offer 51 guest rooms and suites, two presidential suites and the private Chalet Zeno. Visit now, before the crowds descend. –Eva Sandoval\nThere is nowhere on Earth likeGreenland. Spanning more than two million sq km, the world's largest island has a population of less than 57,000. Covered by a vast ice cap and spectacular mountains, itsunspoiled wildernessand majestic fjords aren't just acoveted geopolitical entity; they offer adventures of a lifetime.\nStunning hiking and spellbinding whale watching in summer and traditional dog sledding and the magical aurora in winter all make Greenland a bucket-list destination. However, it has been remote, expensive and time-consuming to reach – until now.\nWith the opening of a new international airport in the capital city of Nuuk and two more following in 2026, getting to Greenland has never been easier. The country is welcoming mindful adventure travellers who love exploring while also respecting its incredible nature and unique Inuit culture. Greenland hasadopted a pledge\"towards better tourism\" and a new law aims to steer funds from tourism towards benefitting local communities.\nA modern town with a historic waterfront, informative museums and impressive art galleries,Nuukis also a launchpad for hiking, fishing and glamping trips and acts as a gateway for exploring a remarkable Arctic territory. Further north inIlulissat, visitors can discover the jaw-dropping icebergs of Disko Bay and dramaticUnesco-recognised Icefjord. In the south, a region once settled by Vikings, there are gorgeous fjords and scenic green hills dotted with sheep farms. –Adrienne Murray Nielsen\nThough just one-sixth the size of England and far less visited than its more famous UK counterparts, Wales is filled with stunning national parks, awe-inspiring medieval castles and virtually no crowds – which only adds to its appeal. The new year offers travellers an additional excuse to explore one of Europe's most up-and-coming destinations: Wales is celebrating 2025 as theYear of Croeso(\"Welcome\"). The year-long event showcases Welsh culture, language and attractions while inviting visitors to \"Feel thehwyl\" – an untranslatable Welsh word describing a deep state of joy that comes from being immersed in the moment.\nIn recent years, Wales has positioned itself at the forefront of sustainable, culturally focused travel. Tourism has helped play a role in the revival of the Welsh language and the nation is in the midst of a multi-year £5 billion programme that uses tourism funds to make various destinations more environmentally sustainable. As part of its Year of Croeso, Wales isinvesting in mobility bikesto help more adventure-seekers explore its wild side. What's more, Wales is home to theWales Coast Path, the only hiking path in the world that runs the entire length of a country's coastline. –Eliot Stein\nLabrador, the mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada, is a vast, rugged region known for its windswept coastal villages, towering icebergs, subarctic forests and massive waterfalls – all underpinned by more than 9,000 years of human history. In 2025, the completion of the last stage of the 1,200kmTrans-Labrador Highway– a feat that took nearly 25 years and $1bn to build – transforms this remote 294,330 sq km landscape into a more accessible destination.\nThe new circular route (known as Expedition 51) connects Labrador with five Canadian provinces while offering detours into the US and even France (viaSt Pierre and Miquelon). To encourage sustainable tourism and celebrate the cultural heritage in this formerly isolated part of the north, the Canadian government has invested $180m into Parks Canada sites in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2025,Red Bay National Historic Site, a Unesco World Heritage Site and former Basque whaling station, will debut a new interactive boardwalk and visitor centre;L'Anse aux Meadows, home to the first Norse settlement in North America, is enhancing its ecological protections and upgrading visitor facilities; whileGros Morne National Parkwill introduce new interpretive exhibits that highlight the park's dramatic geology, wildlife and landscapes. –Diane Selkirk\nTucson has a lot to celebrate in 2025. This year marks the 10th anniversary of when it became the first city in the US to receive aUnesco City of Gastronomydistinction, as well as the 250th anniversary of the city's founding. Originally part of Mexico, the area now called Tucson will celebrate its unique multi-national history, as well as the deep-rooted Native American cultures that make it special, with a free event on 23 August featuring traditional Mexican music and dancing held at thePresidio San Agustin del Tucson. Visitors throughout the year can explore Tucson's miles ofdesert hiking trailsand historic buildings – like the 250-year-oldSan Xavier del Bac, the so-called \"White Dove of the Desert\". Preservation like this points to why the city is set to receive a Sustainability Index Award from theGlobal Destination Sustainability Movement(GDS) this year.\nBut while the building's history is impressive, the nearby gardens reveal an even richer history: they are the oldest continuously cultivated soil in the US. Four thousand years ago, the Tohono O'odham's ancestors farmed squashes, beans and corn on this land. After mixing and melding with Mexican and other Indigenous flavours over the centuries, many of these ancient herbs and crops are still staples in kitchens across the city. Diners can immerse themselves in the city's unique food scene at one of itscity-of-gastronomy-certified restaurantsorHeirloom Farmers Markets, which regularly feature unique local ingredients such as chiltepin chilis, edible cacti called nopales and prickly pear. –Lynn Brown\nKnown as the world's most isolated big city,Perth– and the state ofWestern Australia(WA) – have long played second fiddle to the east coast cities of Melbourne and Sydney. However, withAustralia's only direct flights to Europe, Perth is positioning itself as Australia's western gateway and a global aviation hub, with a $5bn redevelopment of Perth Airport set to enhance the travel experience. And withnew connections to Asia, WA is poised to become a must-visit destination in 2025.\nBut it's not just about getting here – it's about what awaits. Outside of newly cool Perth and its gorgeousSwan Valley Wine Region, WA's vast landscapes span more than 2.5 million sq km, encompassing 12,500km of pristine coastline, bubblegum-pink lakes, horizontal waterfalls, towering karri forests, wildflowers, wineries and wildlife encounters like swimming with whale sharks and snapping selfies with quokkas, the \"happiest animal in the world\". Sustainability-minded road trippers can explore it all on the new6,600km Electric Vehicle Highway, the world's longest EV charging network.\nWA is also championing its rich cultural heritage through the A$20mJina Aboriginal Tourism Action Planthat supports authentic Indigenous-led experiences for travellers as well as Indigenous business development. Learn about the oldest living cultures on Earth on atruth-telling walking tourin Rockingham or a4WD tag-along coast foraging tourcomplete with bush barbecue in Broome.\nAdd ancient petroglyphs atMurujuga National Park(under consideration for Unesco World Heritage status in 2025), new disability-friendly infrastructure and equipment on the stunningHoutman Abrolhos Islands,boutique hotelsin Fremantle andtiny dream staysin the Great Southern, and WA is set to redefine travel to Australia this year. –Ellie Cobb\nFrom its misty hilltop tea plantations and roaming wild elephants to its ancient temples and rolling surf, Sri Lanka is a country that ticks lots of boxes. In April 2022, the former prime minister announced Sri Lanka's bankruptcy, but anew presidentaims to rebuild the country's fortunes after it was hit by a pandemic and civil unrest.\nThe resilient island nation is hoping to get back on its feet through tourism. The city ofKandywill see the opening of its first seven-star hotel,Aviyana Private Chalets, whileAarunya Nature Resorthas a new family villa that includes an oculus for stargazing. There's a$1bn megaresortopening in Colombo, and the launch of Sri Lanka's new airlineAir Ceilão, which will fly as far as Europe and Australia. The nation also recently launched theGood Travel Seal initiative, which celebrates local businesses who have adopted sustainable practices.\nVisitors looking for a coolcation can take alegendary train rideinto its mountainous interior, or travel to Colombo and Galle to discover a new generation of mixologists putting their spin on arrack, a 5th-Century drink. The island has also opened the 300kmPekoe Trail, which takes hikers through tea plantations and rural villages in the Central Highlands. For those who want to cover more ground, an innovative startup allows travellers toself-drive a tuk tukacross the island, with the money going directly to the owner. –Claire Turrell\nAfter managing the Panama Canal for decades, the US handed control of it over to Panama at the end of 1999 in a treaty signed by the late US President Jimmy Carter. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Panama's sovereignty over its namesake waterway, and as President-elect Donald Trumphints at the possibilityof using military force to reseize it, a series of new permanent exhibits at the landmark'sMuseo del Canalhighlighting its path to Panamanian rule feels especially timely.\nYet, there's more to see in this nation of vast jungles, idyllic islands and mountainous forests beyond the canal. In 2024, theMeaningful Travel Map to Panamalaunched in partnership with non-profit Tourism Cares to make it easier for visitors to find locally led travel experiences across the country. After embarking on aLocalinptywalking tour through Panama City's Casco Antiguo and El Chorrillo neighbourhoods, head south-west to the La Pintada district, where artists weave fibers to make traditional Panama hats by hand – a Unesco-recognised practice known assombrero pintao. InEl Valle de Anton(named one of the best community tourism villages byUN Tourism in 2024) take a hike through a lush cloud forest on theCerro Gaital Lookout Trailwhere you can see both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea on a clear day from the summit. This newly opened path is part of Panama's ongoing1,000 km of Trailsproject, which seeks to boost sustainable tourism in rural communities while bringing hikers face to face withPanama's staggering biodiversity. –Kathleen Rellihan\nSnowcapped mountains, sweeping deserts, ancient cities andrich cultural heritagehave long made Morocco one of North Africa's most popular destinations. But theAl Haouz earthquake of September 2023not only devastated parts of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains, it also severely impacted tourism. As Morocco continues to build (and rebuild) its tourism infrastructure in preparation forco-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the nation is aiming todouble its tourist arrivalsin the next five years.\nBypass the crowds by taking a road trip through the Rif Mountains in Morocco's less-frequented northern region.The planned 2025-2027 expansionof Morocco's High-Speed Rail (HSR) network will create a multitude of new train lines, including a link from Rabat to the ancient, 1,300-year-old walled Rif Mountain city ofFez; home to aUnesco World Heritage medinaand the host of several games in theAfrica Cup of Nations 2025. From Fez, it's a 65km drive north to Moulay Idriss, an ancient hilltop village once closed to non-Muslims. Pass through olive and almond groves and mountain villages for a stop inOuezzane– a centre of Sufism – then continue north toTalassemtane National Parkto hike through cedar forests, climb craggy red peaks and dive into natural swimming holes. Further north is the town ofChefchaouen, known as the \"Blue Pearl\" for its blue-painted buildings and streets. Finally, cruise along Morocco's northern coast, unwinding in sleepy Mediterranean fishing villages likeEl Jebhaand the white-washed Spanish colonial buildings ofTetouan. –Alicia Erickson\nThe northern English city ofBradfordis finally poised to step out from the long shadow cast by its giant Yorkshire neighbour, Leeds, as it takes its place as the2025 UK City of Culture. A fabulousyear-long programme of eventsincludes the re-opening of theNational Science and Media Museum, plus innovative celebrations of local cultural icons: more than 400 works by Bradford-born artist David Hockneyheld in a Unesco World Heritage 1850s mill; newdigital takeson a fantasy world dreamed up by the famed literary Brontë sisters; and a musical programme mixing anelectronic bassline symphony,old factory folk music,brass bandsandSouth Asian sounds.\nThe diversity of offerings reflects the eye-opening variety of a city whose historic enclaves like Little Germany – where 19th-Century Teutonic wool merchants built an array of neoclassical warehouses – are complemented by a landscape of dramatic moors that play host to an extraordinaryopen-air immersive sound walkmixing contemporary classical music with asculpture trail. A special energy also comes from the local residents who represent diverse backgrounds (and youth – a quarter are under 20 years old).\nBradford's historic streets and rugged country setting helped the city become Britain's firstUnesco City of Film(an accolade shared with places as varied as Rome, Sydney and Busan) – a setting for screen hits including BBC series like Peaky Blinders and Gentleman Jack, and classic films like The Railway Children andWuthering Heights.\nAnd this year, there's even aninteractive cookbook project, celebrating recipes from local communities and showing that in 2025, Bradford is truly a destination to please all tastes. –Norman Miller\nHome to some of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes and the ancient capital of one of history'smost mysterious civilisations, Jordan never fails to evoke wonder. But take a closer look and you'll find that the country has been quietly building up its reputation as the Middle East's go-to destination for outdoor adventure-seekers.\nIn 2023, a stunning new 10-day, 120km-long hiking path known as theWadi Rum Trailopened, which weaves through the rust-red walls of Jordan's iconic Wadi Rum, tracing the otherworldly landscapes featured in the films Star Wars, Dune and The Martian. Visitors have traditionally breezed through the desert here on 4x4 tours, but this community tourism project promotesa slower, more sustainable form of travelthat protects the desert's delicate ecosystem while safeguarding the rich cultural heritage of the local Bedouin community.\nElsewhere, this Maine-sized nation is teeming with 33 protected land and marine ecosystems. At theWadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve(the world's lowest-lying nature reserve at 410m below sea level), visitors can search for the illusive desert-dwelling Nubian ibex while climbing, swimming and sliding their way through a sandstone gorge to the base of a crashing waterfall.The Dana Biosphere Reserve(Jordan's largest), is home to 180 bird species and 25 endangered mammal species. The rich coral reefs of theAqaba Marine Reserve, which was added to theIUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areasin January 2025, support more than 500 fish species and a growingdivingscene. –Florence Craig\nAlmost completely isolated from the outside world for centuries, this erstwhile hermit kingdom nestled in the Himalayas only began welcoming foreigners in 1974. It's since become a global leader in sustainability: it's theworld's first carbon-negative nation, more than 60% of its land is protected forest and it measuresGross National Happinessinstead of GDP.\nThe Haa Valley, a pristine forested district along Bhutan's western frontier with Tibet, has long been the country's best-kept secret: a culturally distinct region still untouched by mass tourism. This forgotten corner of the Thunder Dragon Kingdom was the last district to open to foreigners in 2002, and today, fewer than 2% of international travellers visit, despite it being a yak's graze from Paro International Airport. It's now emerging from the shadows, balancing preservation with thoughtful development in its bid for more visitors.\nTravellers can explore Haa's raw beauty through the newly restored 400kmTrans Bhutan Trail; the freshly-added 11kmHaa Panorama Trail(a revival of an ancient route); and the two-dayJoy Bay Tsho Trek, which snakes through pastures, canopy forests and bamboo groves between the villages of Mochu and Youkha.\nHaa's commitment to sustainable tourism means you'll find locally run homestays (and some local hotels) offering glimpses into centuries-old rural life. Two distinct, low-impact accommodations have also opened: the community-runKatsho Eco Camp, built along the Haa Panorama Trail by guides and cooks who lost their jobs during the pandemic, and the luxurySangwa Camp.Here, visitors witness local culture, likeBon ritualsand rare experiences such as breakfast in Bhutan'slone strict nature reserve, a highly protected biodiversity hotspot home to rare species like the red panda and snow leopard.\nWith Bhutan'sSustainable Daily Feehalved through 2027 (now $100), this once-secluded paradise is now more accessible while remaining just as committed to low-impact tourism. –Erin Levi\nMore than a year after a series of deadly wildfiresdevastated Maui, the entire state is experiencing a dramaticdownturnin visitors. As families and local businesses continue to rebuild, they're asking travellers to return, but todo so responsibly.\nEnter theMālama Hawaiiprogramme.

As such, the programme pairs travellers with more than 350 volunteer opportunities, ranging fromrestoring native foreststosewing and cookingwith Maui families tohelping to preserve plant and animal habitatson the slopes of Mount Kea. In exchange, travellers receive discounted – or in some cases, free – stays atdozens of hotels and resorts across the islands, including the famousFour Seasons Resort Maui at Waileawhere the first season of The White Lotus was filmed. –Eliot Stein\nUzbekistan has one of the youngest populations in the world – more than 60% are under 30. Being surrounded by a sea of young people on Tashkent's metros, which double as art museums with Soviet-era mosaics, you can see a new generation taking over. As the country strives to maintain its unique traditions and cultures, it is investing in tourism with new hotels, train routes, domestic flights and cultural attractions to grow its economy, retain its youth and attract more visitors.\nUzbekistan is getting its first major international biennial with theBukhara Biennialin September 2025. Other major cultural developments include anexpansion of the State Museum of Artsdesigned by Tadao Ando and the restoration and partial reconstruction of thePalace of Prince Romanov.\nAs of May 2024,citizens of more than 90 countries(including the UK, Canada and Australia) can visit Uzbekistan without a visa. The president has said he intends to create aGlobal Green Tourism Startup Labto bring together the country's commitment to a green economy with tourism. Crossing the border with neighbouring countries has also become easier. The region's first international railway route, theSilk Road railway tour, launched in November 2024 and now connects Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. –Kathleen Rellihan\nHaida Gwaii, an archipelago of more than 150 islands off the coast of British Columbia, offers more than breathtaking landscapes – it provides a profound connection to nature, culture and history. Isolated from the mainland, the ecologically rich islands are home to more than 6,800 species, including endemic birds, mammals and plants that have sustained the Haida People for at least 15,000 years.\nWhat makes Haida Gwaii a standout destination in 2025 is the groundbreakingGaayhllxid/Gíihlagalgang \"Rising Tide\" Haida Title Lands Agreement. This legislation marks a transformative moment in Indigenous rights in Canada, officially recognising the Council of the Haida Nation as the territory's governing body under federal law. This shift is working to revitalise Haida culture and strengthen their environmental stewardship.\nVisitors can explore long-abandoned Haida villages likeSG̱ang Gwaay, a Unesco World Heritage Site with ancient mortuary poles and longhouse remains; and encounter distinctive wildlife such as theHaida Gwaii black bear(calledtaanin the local dialect) and seabirds like puffins and ancient murrelets. Upon arrival, guests are introduced to Haida Laws, including the concept ofGina 'waadluxan gud ad kwaagid(\"everything depends on everything else\"), a teaching that underscores our shared responsibility to care for the Earth. –Diane Selkirk\nHome to mist-shrouded rainforests, emerald lakes, towering volcanoes and one of the Americas' oldest and most attractive cities (Unesco-enshrinedGranada, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in December 2024), Central America's largest country remains one of its least visited. That may soon change with the opening of the new Carretera Costanera: a $400m, 350km-long highway linking 53 beaches along the nation's Pacific Coast, from the Gulf of Fonseca in the north to the turquoise waters of Playa El Naranjo in the south.\n\nSet to be completed in 2025, the ambitious new infrastructure project makes it much easier to shoot south from Nicaragua's sprawling capital, Managua, to the tropical forests and the world-class surf hubs of San Juan del Sur and Popoyo along the country's 50km-long Emerald Coast – which has been luring in-the-know backpackers for years. More importantly, the Costanera is aiming to breathe new economic life into the nation, which isone of the poorestin the Western hemisphere and views itsgrowing tourism sectoras key to its economic growth.\nAfter learning to ride a wave at a locally ownedsurf campand sleeping in atreehousetucked inside a rainforest, venture to theRefugio de Vida Silvestre La Florat the highway's southern tip, where thousands of endangered olive ridley and leatherback turtles lay their eggs between September and October in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. –Eliot Stein\nDespite being ringed on all sides by the UK – Northern Ireland to the west, Scotland to the north, England to the east and Wales to the south – this cliff-fringed island isn't actually part of the Commonwealth. Instead, the self-governing isle is said to be ruled by the world's oldest continuous parliament, the Tynwald, and it's committed to preserving its distinct character and developing a sustainable tourism model.\nAwash with ancient historical sites, such asCashtal yn Ard(\"Castle of the Height\", the largest Neolithic tomb in the British Isles) andCastle Rushen(one of the most complete medieval structures in Europe), the 85,000-resident island is decidedly forward-thinking. In 2016 it was recognised as aUnesco Biosphere(the world's only self-governing territory whose entire land and sea area has such designation) for its commitment to environmental preservation and cultural heritage. This year, witness the isle's spectacular native bird species at the newManx Birdlife Point of Ayre National Reserve, which opened to the public in July 2024. Also on tap for 2025 is the 175th anniversary ofOkell's Brewery, so celebrate this iconic Manx brew by partaking in tasting tours that will be held throughout the year.\nIn addition to learning a few words in Manx Gaelic (the island's historical language) and familiarising yourself with the Manx pound (the island's unique currency), one of the best ways to understand this unique British Crown Dependency is toexplore it on foot. Taking advantage of the isle'smyriadof organisedwalking events, hikers will find rolling English fields, misty Irish hills and craggy Welsh coastlines – as well as dramatic Scottish Highland-esque peaks on the Isle's highest point, Snaefell mountain. On a clear day, trekkers can turn in a circle on its wind-whipped summit to see each country in the UK and Ireland. –Lynn Brown\nPakistan is one of the world's most populated nations, yet it remains one of the great surprises for travellers. That may soon change, as the country is hoping a slew ofresponsible tourism initiativesandnew sustainable effortswill lure eco-conscious visitors to explore its breathtaking northern regions; home to five of the planet's 14 peaks towering over 8,000m – including the world's second highest, K2.\nSalam Pakistan(Pakistan's first-ever national tourism brand, which launched in 2023) allows travellers to easily apply for e-visas and make bookings on the digital platform, including the coveted mountaineering and trekking visa. It only takes a quick glance at the list ofmountain peaksandtreksto see the scale of Pakistan's unmatched adrenaline opportunities.\nYet, Pakistan is much more than staggering mountain trails. The scenic Gilgit-Baltistan region – dubbed \"heaven's gate\" – is brimming with lush valleys, pristine lakes and glacial waterfalls. Cradled between trails are the Hunza Valley's fragrant cherry blossoms and apricot orchards, undulating Unesco-listedDeosai plainsand Shangri-La-esque mirrored lakes. Venture towards the Pakistan-China border to find the Khunjerab Pass, which will be operationalyear-roundstarting in 2025. –Aysha Imtiaz\nMarooned in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean some 1,500km west of Lisbon, this nine-island Portuguese archipelago is one of Europe's most isolated destinations and is known for its steaming natural hot springs, jewel-coloured lakes and sparkling lava tubes. The Azores already boast some of the continent's most dramatic black-sand beaches and bestwhale-watchingopportunities, but the islands can now add another superlative to the list:Europe's largest protected marine sanctuary.\nIn a groundbreaking piece of legislation approved in October 2024, the Azores' newly designated Marine Protected Area will extend 287,000 sq km (an expanse larger than all of Great Britain) and safeguard deep-sea corals, sharks and the 28 species of whales and dolphins found here. Protecting the long-term health and biodiversity of these coral reefs will be a boon for travellers eager to participate in whale-watching and sustainable marine research expeditions in the years to come.\nElsewhere, a scenic drive from the capital of Ponta Delgada,Furnas Valleyis home to two active volcanoes. Spend some time hot spring hopping your way across the bubbling geothermal valley, wander through lush botanical gardens or enjoy a leisurely stroll inTerra Nostra Park, arguably one of Europe's most beautiful parks. Dating back to 1775, the eponymousTerra Nostra Garden Hotelis a bonafide green retreat that will offer guests 24-hour access to their newly enhanced thermal pools and jacuzzis starting in January 2025. Don't leave without sampling thecozido das Furnas– a local meat stew buried underground and slow-cooked using the volcanic hot springs' natural heat. Nearby, sample purple volcanic tea atChalet da Tia Mercês, or plan a visit to the family-ownedGorreana Tea Factory, the oldest (and only) tea plantation in Europe. –Michelle Gross\nKansas City, Missouriis making 2025 its glow-up year. The city heretofore known as \"Paris of the Plains\" is busily promoting its creative arts scene and status as one of North America's barbeque capitals, all while launching an urban revitalisation plan that includes new museums, entertainment districts and hotels.\nAt the heart of the rebrand is theMuseum of BBQ, the world's first museum dedicated to the art of smoked meat. Slated to open at theCrown Centershopping district in spring 2025, the immersive experience will delve intoKansas City's deep barbeque culture, leading visitors through interactive exhibits culminating in a gift shop selling all manner of BBQ goods.\nTheBerkley Riverfrontwill continue to see new dining experiences, shops and apartment buildings among its incoming development.\nTheKansas City International Airportcompleted significant renovations in 2023, with the $1.5bn expansion replacing outdated terminals and improving passenger flow. This year will also see upgrades to theKC Streetcar; a 3.5-mile Main Street extension expected to open this summer that will make it even easier to reach some of the city's premier destinations, including theUnion Hillshopping district and theNational WWI Museum and Memorial– home to the world's most comprehensive collection of World War One objects and documents. And whenRock Island Bridgere-opens in spring 2025, it will become the site of a new entertainment district ­set 40ft feet over a river.– Eva Sandoval\nEven if you've alreadystargazedat the spacelikeUyuni salt flats(the world's largest) and trekked breathlessly around the hilly capital of La Paz (the world's highest), Bolivia is worth a visit in 2025. This August marks the country's 200th anniversary and it's celebrating with events and attractions throughout the year in the capitals of its nine regions.\nVisit from 24 February to 5 March for theOruro Carnival, which includes a multi-day folk-dance parade and has earned Unesco Heritage status for preserving oral tradition. In Potosí, sip abicentennialsingani(Bolivia's answer to Peru'spisco). This strong spirit, now a symbol of national pride, is said to have started viticulture in the region in the 1500s in what was once a booming mining town – and Potosí still has the colonial architecture to prove it.\nBolivia has thelargest proportion of Indigenous people in South America, with roughly two-thirds of the population directly related to the area's original inhabitants. Bolivia's prettiest city, Chuquisaca (also called Sucre), where the declaration of independence was signed in 1825, is home to many Quechua peoples. While there, be suer to visit theMuseo de Arte Indígenafor an up-close look at the country's ancient textile tradition. The Aymara people of the altiplano welcome visitors to the Isla del Sol (an island in the middle of Lake Titicaca) whose moonlike terrain makes for an incredible daylong hike. Elsewhere, a new network ofcommunity-based tourismbrings attractions (and work opportunities) to these sometimes-remote communities, such as theChalalan Ecolodgein the Amazon'sMadidi National Park, where capybaras, cougars and macaws make their homes. –Laura Norkin\nBotswana has been hailed as Africa's leader in green safari tourism due to its expansive wildlife reserves and the government's focus on high-income, low-impact ecotourism policies; a strategy that has traditionally meant allowing fewer tourists. But as the countryushers in a new governmentand continues to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, its tourism sector (and sustainable cache) only stands to grow in 2025, with an increased demand for sustainable and culturally immersive travel experiences. In a bid to bolster tourism and strengthen the economy, Botswana has granted visa-free entry to visitors from 104 countries in recent years – including those from the US, UK, Germany and Canada. This means more travellers can now explore Botswana's natural beauty, including the \"Elephant Capital of the World\",Chobe National Park, and the Unesco-listedOkavango Delta; a vast wetland in the Kalahari Desert that is one of the world's last havens for cheetahs and the black rhinoceros.\nThe Okavango Delta will also see a number of new openings, including the 100% solar-poweredMbamba Campin the delta's lagoon-and-savannah-dotted north, a luxury lodge offering a blend of comfort and family-friendly wildlife adventures that's slated to open in April 2025. Opening in May 2025 isMonachira Camp,where visitors can enjoy walking safaris, mokoro canoe rides andarmchair safariswhile coming face to face with elephants, lions and the Pel's Fishing Owl.\nStarting in April 2025, new Air Botswana routes will connect Gaborone to Cape Town, making it even easier for visitors to explore Botswana's magical nature for themselves – sustainably. –Eva Sandoval\n\"Is it even a city?\" arecent viral adfor Oslo, Norway asked. The tongue-in-cheek video nodded to how overtourism has sullied other European capitals while showcasing the Norwegian capital'sextreme walkability;world-class dining; and easy access to nearby fjords, islands and serenepostcard-perfect landscapes. Known for its modern architecture, sweeping waterfront and no shortage of trees (it's one ofEurope's most-forested cities), Oslo is luring the kinds of visitors who will do their part to ensure that it remainsone of the world's most sustainable cities.\nVisitors here are encouraged to refer to theVisit Oslo Responsiblyguidelines and theGreen Oslo Guide, which break down the concept of sustainable tourism into four categories: planet, people, prosperity and partnership. It's not unusual for hotels in the city centre to feature green roofs that produce food, reduce energy use, manage rainwater and support urban biodiversity.\nTravellers can ensure their visit has a positive impact on residents and the local environment by supporting local businesses like theNorwegian Adventure Company, which offers \"life-changing and sustainable experiences\" from its base in Oslo, like kayaking through glacier-carved fjords, and chasing the Northern Lights.After a long day of exploring the spectacular Nordic countryside, dine at one of the city's many farm-to-table restaurants,likethe Michelin-starredMaaemo, which utilises locally grown organic produce. So, is it even a city?

    "content": "The Spanish government has called for the removal of the listings of nearly 66,000 properties on rental platform Airbnb on the grounds that they breach regulations for tourist accommodation.\nThe clampdown comes as protests against over-tourism have begun ahead of the summer season. Demonstrations in the Canary Islands on Sunday attracted thousands of people.\nThe minister for social rights, consumer affairs and the 2030 Agenda, Pablo Bustinduy, said the rental properties in question had \"violated various norms regarding housing for tourist use\".\nThe announcement followed a Madrid court ruling that Airbnb must immediately withdraw from the market 4,984 of the properties cited by the ministry.\nThe properties are in six regions: Madrid, Andalusia, Catalonia, Valencia, the Basque Country and the Balearic Islands.\nBustinduy's ministry is now awaiting further judicial rulings on the other 60,000 or so properties whose listings it deems unlawful.\nAccording to the ministry, the properties it has identified either did not provide a licence number, provided an erroneous number, or did not specify the legal status of the owner to show whether they were renting on a professional basis or as a private individual.\nHe described the court's decision as \"a clear victory for those who fight to protect the right to housing\".\nBustinduy added that \"it can be possible to ensure that no economic interest has priority over housing and that no company, however big or powerful, is above the law\".\nHousing has emerged as Spaniards' biggest concern in recent months, due to spiralling rental costs, particularly in larger towns and cities.\nRead more:Spanish fightback against record tourism\nThe cost of an average rental has doubled over the last decade, while salaries have failed to keep up.\nTourist apartments have been identified by many as a major cause of the problem, depriving local residents of accommodation.\nSpain is the world's second most popular tourist destination after France, with 94 million foreign visitors in 2024, a 13% rise on the previous year.\nSocialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said earlier this year \"there are too many Airbnbs and not enough homes\", and he promised to prevent the \"uncontrolled\" expansion of the use of properties for tourism.\nSome local governments have also started to act against Airbnb.\nBarcelona City Hall has said it will eliminate its 10,000 short-term tourist apartmentsby the end of 2028.\nOthers have taken a different approach. In recent months, Airbnb has reached agreements with local authorities in the Canary Islands, Ibiza and Murcia aimed at ensuring property owners comply with tourist rental rules.\nAirbnb responded to the court ruling and Bustinduy's announcement by insisting it would appeal against decisions linked to this case and that no evidence of rule-breaking by hosts had been provided.\nIt also cited a 2022 ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court which found that the responsibility for listing information lay with the host of each property, not the company, which was a \"neutral intermediary\" and not a real estate provider.\nThe firm also made a broader point about the Spanish housing problem.\n\"The root cause of the affordable housing crisis in Spain is a lack of supply to meet demand,\" said a spokesperson. \"Governments across the world are seeing that regulating Airbnb does not alleviate housing concerns or return homes to the market – it only hurts local families who rely on hosting to afford their homes and rising costs.\"\nLast summer, Spain saw a wave of protests against over-tourism in many popular destinations, with its impact on housing the biggest grievance.\nWith the number of foreign visitors to Spain fast approaching 100 million per year, the unrest is expected to continue this summer.\nOn Sunday, several thousand people took to the streets across the Canary Islands under the slogan \"Canaries have a limit\".\nIn Majorca, a group calledMenys Turisme, Més Vida(Less tourism, more life) is preparing for similar actions, with a protest scheduled for 15 June.\n"

    "content": "There are doubts over whether UK passport holders will be able to use e-gates at EU airports this summer.\nThe EU Commission has told the BBC that UK citizens will not have access to them until a new scheme to enhance border security comes into force in October, and even then it is up to individual countries.\nWhen asked if e-gates would be available this summer, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told the BBC: \"Nothing is going to happen before that's [the new scheme] in place.\"\nSince the UK left the EU bloc, many popular holiday destinations have seen long queues of British travellers at airports as they wait for passports to be checked.\nThe new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) gathers biometric data on citizens arriving in the EU from non-member, third-party countries, which includes the UK.\nAfter technology delays, it is now due to roll out in October 2025.\n\"The EU is introducing this new entry and exit scheme so nothing is going to happen before that's in place, and that's not yet in place. They've put the date back for that a few times, the latest date is the autumn, let's see if that's stuck to.\n\"After that it's up to the member states. But this gives us the possibility, I'd say the probability, that people will be able to use the e-gates in future, which is not a possibility at the moment,\" McFadden added.\nMonday's deal between the UK and the EUsays there will be \"no legal barriers to eGate use for British Nationals traveling to and from EU Member States after the introduction of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES)\".\nThe prime minister's official spokesperson said that the UK would \"be working with member states to roll that out as quickly as possible\", adding that \"talks have started with individual EU nations\".\nAn EU Commission spokesperson told the BBC that the introduction of the EES would open the possibility of using e-gates for all non-EU citizens, including UK citizens and mean faster processing at borders.\n\"Once the EES is in place, UK nationals will therefore be able to use e-gates where they are available, provided they are registered in the system.\"\n\nSome EU countries already allow UK citizens to use their e-gates, so it is possible that talks with individual nations could result in more letting British passengers use their gates this summer.\nSpeaking about the agreement on Tuesday with supermarket workers, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"They were excited about the e-gates and being able to go on their holidays, which they have obviously already planned, and not be in the horrendously long queues. \"\nThe inclusion of e-gates in the deal has surprised some in the travel industry, as they had understood the gates were always going to be available to UK passport holders in the EU once EES begins in October.\nJulia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel group, said:\n\"This new deal appears to offer little more than expanded access to e-gates which are already in use at some destinations and only after the long-delayed digital border system (EES) is introduced, currently planned for an October launch.\"\nCurrently, EU destinations which already allow UK passport holders to use e-gates often then require a secondary check and a passport stamp.\nThe new deal and EES means UK passport holders will likely no longer require a stamp.\nThe launch of EES has been in the pipeline for a while. It will see non-EU nationals needing to add their biometric data to a new EU database, which will be done at the point of departure to the EU, either at an airport, port or train station.\n"

    "title": "'Food is the thing that grounds them': What happens to family recipes when home no longer exists?",
    "content": "In her new book, Chef Hawa Hassan shares dishes and stories from conflict zones, showing how food can preserve culture, even when so much else is lost.\nWhen Ali Zaman makesUzbeki Kabuli pulao– Afghanistan's national rice and lamb dish – he always adds a splash of toasted sesame oil to enhance the flavour. The New York City coffee-shop owner, whose roots stretch from Queens to Kabul and Maimana, is passionate about sharing the flavours of his heritage. \"Home isn't merely a place on the map,\" he is quoted as saying inSetting a Place for Us, the new book by James Beard Award-winning chef Hawa Hassan. \"It's a feeling that transcends borders.\"\nThat sentiment flows through every page of Hassan's latest work, which explores the powerful connection between food, identity and displacement. Echoing the format of her acclaimed debutIn Bibi's Kitchen, this latest collection combines history, personal stories and traditional recipes from eight countries affected by conflict and displacement, including Yemen, El Salvador, Lebanon and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nFrom the poignant account of a Baghdadi brewer who had to flee his home twice to a recipe for the intoxicating flavours of Egyptianfil fil mahshi(stuffed peppers), the book chronicles the stories and dishes people carry with them when war, disaster or exile forces them to leave everything else behind, while exploring the larger question of how food helps ground people in times of trouble.\nBBC Travel spoke to the Somali-American chef and author about documenting diaspora through food, what she learned from the people she interviewed and what it means to set a place at the table for cultures often left out of the story.\nThere are now so many places around the world where people have been displaced through conflict and disaster. How did you choose which places to represent in the book?\nI always tell people that I picked them because I also wanted to examine my own story and what that looked like, but the truth is that I chose these countries based on conflict and instability, humanitarian concern, and then, lastly, historical and cultural significance. Despite their struggles, these nations hold such deep-rooted parts of our own history. I wanted to talk about the cradle of civilisation in Iraq; I wanted to talk about trade in Lebanon; I wanted to talk about ancient Egypt. When we think about displacement and war, oftentimes it becomes the single story as opposed to the full story of a place.\nEach recipe is paired with a personal story. Why was it important to put faces and names to these dishes?\nThat was the framework that I used in Bibi's Kitchen, bringing people in and saying: \"It's stories and recipes from grandmothers on the Indian Ocean.\" The same is true here: [when you] put a name on the recipe, put a face on it, it makes it real, brings it to life [and] makes it tangible. I think people are interested in other people. I think that's always been the framework for me. People first, food second. Stories [come] first.\nMore like this:\n•The flawless biscuit that took years to master\n•West Africa’s Michelin-starred cuisine wows London\n•The artichoke so prized that people sell fakes\nCan you share a favourite story from the book?\nThere isn't just one powerful story – everyone I spoke to shared something meaningful and full of impact. I hope the overall breadth of the book is what readers find powerful. It's the collective weight of these voices that tells the real story. The communities in this book show us what it looks like to carry home with you, even when you've been uprooted. That spirit is what's most important and inspiring.\nHow did the people you interviewed respond when you asked them to share their stories and recipes?\nTenderly. There was laughter, some tears and always, always a deep sense of pride.\nWhy do you think food holds identity so powerfully, especially in times of displacement?\nI got into food shortly after reuniting with my family, after 15 years of being apart. I started to question all that I had erased or tried to erase. I think in order for me to have got to the point where I am now, it was really important for me to understand where I came from. So I think sometimes food can provide a calling back of sorts to where we're from, or even sometimes give direction for where we're going.\nThe thing that I've come to understand is that [food is] sensory. A smell can place you in a whole different time in your life. A taste can place you at a whole different place. And I think that it's common: no matter who you are or where you are, you have to eat.\nWhen I was thinking about this book, [someone] said to me: \"I don't think people care about food when there's bombs going off over their heads.\" And I was like… \"Actually, food is the thing that grounds them.\"\nWhy was it important for you to tell stories of immigration and displacement, especially right now?\nSomebody needs to keep a record. Not just one person, but many people need to tell their stories as loud as possible so that the people in charge do not silence us into fear or into being othered.\nMore than ever, we need stories, we need storytellers, we need people who keep cultures intact. We need chefs; we need home cooks. I don't care if your way of being proactive in these times is just cooking a meal for a bunch of people who are trying to figure out the solution. I think more than ever, it's important to be at the table. And even if you don't know what the story is, listen to the other people who have a story to share.\nWhat do you hope readers will take away from Setting a Place for Us?\nI hope they come away with a deeper respect for the quiet, everyday ways people preserve culture. That they see how food is never just food – it's memory, identity and survival. This book isn't just a collection of recipes; it's a chorus of voices that have too often been left out of the story. My hope is that readers will cook these dishes, share them, and in doing so, make room at the table for all of us. "

    "title": "Inside the life of Old Delhi's only female pigeon keeper",
    "content": "In the male-dominated world of Delhi's kabootarbazi, one woman's passion for her birds has earned her respect, admiration – and a place in the sky.\nAs dusk descends on Old Delhi, the bustling streets grow even more crowded, with pedestrians inching forward through jam-packed streets and auto-rickshaws honking impatiently. But above the chaos, a quieter ritual takes flight. On rooftops across the old quarters,kabootarbaaz(pigeon keepers) release their cherished flocks into the sky. Whistles pierce the air and calls echo from rooftop to rooftop. And the birds respond, transforming the skyline into a swirling spectacle.\nPigeon keeping in Old Delhi is more than a pastime; it's an umbilical cord to the identity of Old Delhi that's rooted in the city's Mughal heritage. \"A kabootarbaaz takes immense pride in their pigeons,\" says Ratnendu Ray, who conducts heritage walks in Delhi for the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH). \"It's a sense of self, cultural identity and belonging.\"\nThe tradition of pigeon keeping, known askabootarbazi,dates to ancient times, tracing its roots to the era of theMahabharata(between 400BC and AD200) when the birds were kept in palaces to entertain royalty. \"Women of the court would often sit in theirjharokhas(balconies) and watch the pigeons in flight,\" says author and historian Rana Safvi.\nHowever, she explains, it was under the Muslim rulers that this pastime evolved into a popular sport.\n\"The sport reached its zenith under Emperor Jahangir, who likened kabutarbaazi toishqbaazi(the art of love) and brought expert pigeon trainers to Delhi, elevating the tradition to a new level of refinement.\"\nThousands of pigeon keepers across the city carry on this tradition, rising through the ranks fromshagird, or trainee, eventually rising to be akhalifa. \"[They are] finally recognised by the fraternity as anustaad– the highest level one can attain,\" says Ray.\nWhile kabootarbazi is traditionally a man's job passed down from father to son over the centuries, Shaheen Parveen has the distinction of being the only female pigeon keeper in Delhi.\nIn the neighbourhood of Khawaja Mir Dard Basti, Parveen transitions through various roles in a day, from devoted wife to mother to grandmother. However, as soon as she is alone, she climbs up the bamboo stairs that lead to the rooftop of her house, high above the crammed lanes where men savour kebabs frying in small eateries.\nShe starts her day inspecting her more than 100 pigeons, ensuring that each one is healthy before feeding them a custom grain mix. She then trains them through timed flights, using whistles or claps for recall. Evenings involve roll calls and nest checks; she also perfects their skills for competitions.\nAt sunset, Parveen's voice stands out from the myriad calls of men echoing for pigeons. As she raises her voice to the highest pitch, people peer out of their windows and from their terraces to catch a glimpse of their favourite pigeon keeper.\nBeing a kabootarbaaz is both tradition and passion, and Parveen says that spending time with the birds brings her a sense of peace and tranquillity. \"If I don't spend time with them, I feel sick; they are like my children,\" she says.\nParveen's rise to the respected status she now holds within the male-dominated community has been far from easy.\nShe credits her father for her love of the sport. \"Every day after returning from school, he would take me to the rooftop to see his pigeons and that is when my love for the birds began,\" she says. However, she had to contend with the disapproval of her brother, who forbade her from pursuing the hobby. Later, she faced criticism from others who claimed it was unbecoming for a woman.\nHowever, she persisted, driven by her love for the birds. \"When your skills are praised and the community respects you for them, you feel uplifted, then the voices of those who speak against you don't matter,\" she says. \"Let people say whatever they want to, I will continue doing what I want and what gives me peace.\"\nParveen has earned widespread respect across the community for her talents. \"People see the visit of an experienced pigeon keeper to their roofs as a blessing; I receive many offers from people requesting me to bless their pigeons,\" she says with a smile. However, she usually declines these offers: \"I don't get time from my own pigeons; also it is tiring.\"\nExperienced pigeon keepers like Mohsin Ustaad take out time from their busy schedules to support Parveen with feed and medicine, expenses that she sometimes struggles to afford. \"I came to her terrace because I respect her and have admiration for her skill,\" says Mohsin. Parveen smiles shyly: \"It costs thousands of rupees – thankfully Mohsin helps us.\"\nParveen's biggest triumph came when her pigeons won a major local race that drew hundreds of ustaads and hobbyists from Old Delhi and beyond – many of whom had trained their birds for months or years in preparation. In the race, the pigeons were released from a remote location and had to find their way back home. Judging was based on speed, endurance and how well the pigeons responded to their ustaad's calls.\nMore like this:\n•Thirteen photos that will make you care about the ocean\n•A 58-tunnel slow train through India's Eastern Ghats\n•Witnessing the synchronised dance of a million starlings in Denmark\nRace winners are awarded trophies, cash prizes and immense respect within the kabootarbazi community. Afterwards, scores of pigeon keepers presented Parveen with gifts. \"Some even gave me money. It was like India had won the World Cup, some put garlands on me, I was nervous and happy,\" she says, showing videos and pictures of the event.\n\"People recognised her, she got more respect,\" her daughter adds.\nPigeon keeping has also become an attraction for travellers visiting Delhi, who are intrigued to see a way of life they may have seen in Bollywood movies but never witnessed for themselves.\nKabootarbaazi, Ray says, is governed by a rich set of social structures, unspoken rules and codes of conduct. \"Pigeon-keepers often operate within specific territories, usually based around their neighbourhood or rooftop,\" he explains. \"Venturing into territory of others is seen as disrespectful. There are also competitions and tournaments; witnessing all of it is a traveller's delight.\"\nHis heritage walkPrayer, power and pigeon: A heritage walk and kabootarbazintroduces visitors to this world, walking through the winding alleys between houses and watching the birds soaring through the open city skies.\nContent creators are also flocking to Old Delhi to capture the sight of the birds soaring and swirling in the sky. As they climb up to the terraces, seasoned pigeon keepers spring into action. They tighten their grip on the mesh used to guide the birds mid-flight with swift, practiced motions; they whistle, clap and call out in rhythmic chants.\nThe pigeons, mid-flight, respond in unison, veering back toward home, their wings slicing through the air in a synchronised dance. \"I've been following pages of pigeon keepers on YouTube and other platforms for some time now,\" says Imran Ahmed, who came to take photos for his social media platforms. \"Today, I'm glad to finally be among them, capturing photos and being photographed alongside these beautiful birds.\"\nAs the day ends, Parveen climbs to her terrace and lets her birds out. When they reach a certain height, she calls them to return. They respond right away. \"I train each bird to recognise my voice, to know my call and trust me. It's a bond that you can't build overnight,\" Parveen explains, adjusting her pigeons' feed.\nThough not an official ustaad yet, her skill and status are undeniable. \"These birds feel my moods, and I feel theirs,\" she says, smiling. \"In this world of feathers and sky, they know me as I know them. That's something no one can take from me.\" "

    "content": "The cheesy, peppery pasta dish has become as viral as chef Nadia Munno's cooking videos. Here are her favourite places to get it in her hometown of Rome.\nFor Roman chef and businesswoman Nadia Caterina Munno – better known to her five million-strong legion of social media followers as \"The Pasta Queen\" – the rich pasta dish ofcacio e pepe, represents everything she loves about her hometown.\n\"Romans are loud, aggressive, but really friendly. Their friendliness is a form of love,\" she says. \"Roman cuisine is [also] very punchy and aggressive – up [in northern Italy], dishes are more delicate – and cacio e pepe is very traditionally Roman.\"\nIndeed, made by simply tossing pasta, Pecorino cheese, hot pasta water and toasted black peppercorns together, cacio e pepe (literally: \"'cheese and pepper\") is Roman cuisine par excellence: humble, salty and spontaneous.\nIn recent years, the dish has become afirm favourite overseas, with restaurants from New York to London proudly serving their versions of the savoury recipe. It has also become one of the main stars of Munno's larger-than-life home cooking videos, which are peppered with aSophia Loren-esque theatricalityand replete with gushing references to the \"pasta gods\".\nMunno's own royal moniker may pose a rather grand claim, but she's hardly a usurper: she heralds from a family that has been producing pasta for centuries, even garnering the nickname of the \"Macaronis\".\n\"To be a 'pasta queen' you have to have an experience and a background: these are the dishes I cooked all my life,\" she explains. \"I want to teach people about the values of Italian food, which bring people together, to enjoy life a bit more.\"\nShe adds: \"Food shouldn't be treated as an afterthought. Empires were forged on food.\"\nAnd though Rome's history may be imperial, cacio e pepe – much like other classic Roman pasta dishes likecarbonaraandamatriciana– is a humble dish, deeply rooted in the city's working class culture, with influences from the nearby shepherds who moved to Rome from the Apennine mountains. What may come to a surprise to some is that cacio e pepe is not even one of the most consumed dishes in the Roman kitchen. Its recent popularity, Munno says, is largely a product of social media marketing.\n\"It's not as sought after from Romans as from tourists who come to visit the city,\" Munno notes. \"It's definitely traditional, but cacio e pepereally has gone viral, being popularised internationally.\"\nAll this notwithstanding, the dish is now a consolidated part of Rome's culinary repertoire, a staple in trattorie and family homes across the city.\nHere are Munno's favourite places to get cacio e pepe in Rome.\nIf there's any restaurant in Rome which can legitimately lay claim to being the \"king\" of cacio e pepe, it'sFelice a Testaccio– and Munno recommends going there to experience the dish like a true local.\n\"I liked going to [Felice a Testaccio] because I grew up nearby,\" Munno says. \"It's a place which is popular with the local people, and the food is amazing.\"\nFor Felice a Testaccio, cacio e pepe is a veritable artform – and one whose creation is displayed to clients, as themantecatura(emulsification) of the pasta in the Pecorino cheese is performed tableside.\nUsing freshtonnarelli(thick spaghetti), Felice a Testaccio's cacio e pepeis decadent, sharp and creamy, the Roman dish in its most sumptuous form.\nAs its name suggests, Felice is located in the city's scruffy, vibrant Testaccio neighbourhood, which was built onthe remains of an ancient Roman trash heapand the port that serviced the city with its food. Today, the neighbourhood maintains its culinary tradition as the location of the monumental Testaccio food market.\n\"It's one of the main markets of Rome,\" Munno says.\nThe district, located south of the city centre, doesn't quite reek of \"dolce vita\" in the postcard-perfect, Hollywood sense – think less Roman Holiday and more graffitied walls and post-war apartment blocks – but it's as quintessentially Roman as it gets, and Munno recommends sinking your teeth into – and its food.\n\"The area doesn't get enough love,\" Munno says. \"But it'sveryRoman.\"\nWebsite:https://feliceatestaccio.com\nAddress: Via Mastro Giorgio, 29, 00153\nPhone: + 39 06 574 6800\nInstagram: @feliceatestaccio\nWhen it comes to finding a more refined, gourmet-approved take on Roman cuisine, thenRoscioli Salumeria con Cucinais your port of call.\nThe restaurant – opened near the Campo de' Fiori street market in 1972 and now part of a local chain of bakeries and eateries – offers sophisticated, yet still authentic, takes on classic Roman and other Italian dishes, within an elegant setting that attracts an exclusive clientele. Its ingredients are sourced from the best suppliers, and its cacio e pepe is no exception.\n\"Roscioli is truly authentic Roman [food],\" Munno says. \"What they serve is truly amazing.\"\nUsing freshtagliolinipasta, Nepalese black pepper and a touch of extra virgin olive oil to help bind the sauce, Roscioli's cacio e pepe is delicate and refined, yet still full of the tangy saltiness of the traditional Roman recipe.\n\"It's incredibly gorgeous,\" Munno says.\nReserve in advance, as bookings can be competitive.\nWebsite:https://www.roscioli.com\nAddress: Via dei Giubbonari, 21, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 687 5287\nInstagram:@rosciolisalumeria\nHostaria da Cesare, which celebrated its centennial anniversary in 2021, brims with nostalgia, with a distinct \"frozen-in-time-feel\": a time capsule of what may seem like a bygone era.\nWarm, wood-panelled interiors give it a distinctly cosy, mid-century charm. Da Cesare's cacio e pepe – one of the city's best, according to Munno – is traditional and rich, made with spaghetti, coated in a flurry of shaved Pecorino and black pepper.\nConveniently placed in the central Prati quarter, an elegant, 19th-Century Parisian-esque grid of streets close to the Vatican, Hostaria Da Cesare is centrally located but also somewhat shielded from the tourist throngs.\n\"It isn't particularly touristy, but it's getting more attention,\" Munno says.\nWebsite:https://www.ristorantecesare.com\nAddress: Via Crescenzio, 13, 00193\nPhone: +39 06 686 1227\nTrattoriaDa Teodoesn't feel like an ordinary restaurant – it feels more like a dining room a family graciously opened up to the public.\nDeep in the Trastevere district south of the Vatican, Da Teo is set in a neighbourhood which – in spite of its popularity with tourists – has preserved its medieval charm and a fierce community spirit.\n\"Trastevere is magical,\" Munno says. \"It's a crazy neighbourhood which gives you a whole different experience [and] energy.\"\n\"You have people dancing, clubs, young people, cats,\" she adds. \"The heart and vibe of Rome.\"\nMunno believes Da Teo offers a taste of Trastevere's \"intense, exhilarating Roman vibe\" and recommends going there with a significant other. \"Going [there] with a lover is so romantic,\" she says.\nTossed in an especially thick, creamy homestyle sauce, Da Teo's take on the Roman dish feels less like a restaurant serving and more akin to something your nonna would whip you up for Sunday lunch.\nWebsite:https://m.facebook.com/Trattoria.da.TEO/\nAddress: Piazza dei Ponziani, 7A, 00153\nPhone: +39 06 581 8355\nInstagram:@trattoriadateo\nFlavio al Veloavevodettois perhaps one of the most unique eateries in a city packed with historical oddities, in that it is located quite literally inside an ancient Roman trash heap: the Monte Cocci, a hill made up of discardedamphorae(vases).\n\"It's an incredible experience you can't get anywhere else,\" Munno says.\nIn spite of its remarkable setting, the restaurant nevertheless makes simple, traditional food for a largely local clientele – and, Munno notes, is a great place to experience dishes like cacio e pepe.\n\"[Flavio] has a typical family style,\" Munno says. \"It isn't super fancy.

    "title": "From sea sparkles to fireflies: Chasing Australia's 'big four'",
    "content": "In Australia's Illawarra region, a ghostbusting-style night tour reveals ghost fungi, sea sparkles and tiny creatures lighting up the dark.\nOn a slate-black night, I stare at a horizon freckled with stars. Only this isn't the sky, illuminated by hundreds of constellations; it's the muddy bank of a river, charged by a colony of glow worms.\n\"This is my TV,\" says David Finlay. \"It's magical, like something out of Avatar.\" By day, Finlay works as a transport manager, but by night, he scours Australia's bushland and beaches chasing living light. \"If you're tucked up at home, you miss these things. Everybody cocoons themselves at night, whereas I think, what fun can I have?\" he says.\nBioluminescent creatures lurk in many corners of the world, but Australia's Illawarra region on New South Wales' south coast is a magnet for glowing phenomena. With low light pollution, ample rainfall and high humidity, it's an ideal microclimate for these creatures to thrive and trap prey.\nMany are clustered along theIllawarra Escarpment, a sweep of sandstone cliffs, fringed with forests that roll into the Pacific Ocean. \"Our escarpment habitat is special. It's a well-preserved subtropical rainforest environment, which helps protect fragile bioluminescent life forms,\" says Finlay.\nFrom his home in Kiama, Finlay can spot the \"big four\" within an hour's drive. There's sea sparkle, plankton that paints the ocean an electric blue; ghost fungi, mushrooms that radiate an eerie green; and glow worms and fireflies, which pierce the night-sky like tiny lanterns.\nThese natural phenomena are notoriously unpredictable and fickle to find, dictated by seasons, weather and light patterns. They are also extremely fragile, asmounting evidenceshows bioluminescent creatures are waning with climate-change and human disturbance.\nBut for a growing number of glow seekers, who, like Finlay, visit with care, the challenge is part of the adventure.\nWhen I meet Finlay at a clearing near Cascade Falls inMacquarie Pass National Park, it's only an hour past sunset, yet we're cloaked in darkness. It's Friday night, and while most people are under artificial lights, toasting to the end of the week, we're here to find natural shimmers in the night.\nWe trek through a path that cuts through the towering eucalypt trees, our head torches glowing red to cause minimal disturbance to wildlife. The full Moon pilots from above and the flow of the river whooshes us forward, guiding our footsteps towards the waterfall. \"If something flies straight past your face, it's probably just a micro bat,\" warns Finlay. \"They're very gentle, they're just looking for insects to eat.\"\nCascade Falls has an ideal microclimate for glow worms and fireflies, he explains. Glow worms aren't worms – in Australia and New Zealand, they are the larvae of fungus gnat. Elsewhere in the world, the glow often comes from beetles. They hide in wet, dark places, such as dank caves, abandoned tunnels or thick rainforest.\nGlow worms are endemic to Australia and New Zealand, and while many travellers visit iconic spots likeTamborine Mountainin Queensland, there are lesser-known colonies that can be discovered if you know where to look.\nAs my eyes adjust, I begin to notice more – the gnarled roots of a tree and a feathery mushroom cap. Finlay's vision is far better trained; he can easily spot silver spiders eyes blinking at us like cat's eyes on a motorway. He sweeps a UV torch across the floor, illuminating the undergrowth. A caterpillar glows fluorescent white, some lichen neon green, a leaf an aggressive shade of electric blue. \"Ah, that's just possum wee,\" he clarifies.\nFinlay runs ad hoc glow tours (when available, he posts them on hisFacebook page) in the Illawarra, showing locals and visitors the spectacle that most of us overlook at night. Last year, a few hundred places on his guided walks sold in a flash – as 25,000 people vied to secure a spot.\n\"For a lot of people, it's like finding gold, and nobody will tell you where they find the gold,\" says Finlay.\nBut it's a delicate balance between educating visitors and conserving these habitats. \"This national park is already impacted by people. I don't tell people about the really natural spots, as too many people would destroy those environments,\" he says.\nMore like this:\n•The Indian Ocean's laid-back 'paradise on Earth'\n•India's mysterious glowing forests\n•How a fictitious 'sea' became a top Maldivian tourist attraction\nBoth fireflies and glow worms are incredibly sensitive, susceptible to habitat destruction from people, urbanisation and bush fires. The \"Black Summer\" bushfires of 2019-20 wiped out a \"horrific\" number of bioluminescent creatures, he says, withcolonies impactedin national parks across Australia.\n\"I give people a list of dos and don'ts when they're out in the environment, and I tell them to teach other people this,\" says Finlay.\nA golden rule, like almost everything in the natural world, is to look but not touch. \"So much as holding a glow worm in the palm of your hand will kill them,\" says Finlay. Bright flashing lights or even breathing too close can trigger them to shut down and disrupt their feeding patterns. We keep our voices low and hushed, and we tread carefully, making sure to move through the bush slowly.\nFor safety, Finlay suggests bringing a friend on a night adventure. He beams a laser pointer through the sky, tracing the kite-like constellation of the Southern Cross, in case I ever get lost and need to navigate my way south.\nWe scramble down the embankment towards the mouth of the waterfall, following the tiny orbs of light. Tucked in the overhang of the river are dozens of glow worms, like a fairy grotto or twinkling Christmas light display. Up close, tendrils of silky web drip down, hanging like strings of pearls.\n\"Glow worms hide from sunlight, they'll crawl into nooks and crannies during the day, and when they come out at night, they have to rebuild their webs,\" says Finlay. Despite their beauty, these webs are death traps – snaring insects that are lured by glow-worm light.\nUnder the lens of the camera, the riverbank looks even more spectacular, with crystal droplets clustered around an iridescent light. It's clear whyBioluminescence Australia– a Facebook group with more than 64,000 members – has become so popular. The page was created to share photos of bioluminescent phytoplankton blooms, but it's also a message board for tracking down glowing phenomena.\nGlow hunters follow a rough calendar – glow worms can generally be found year-round, whereas fireflies glimmer for a short window in Australia's late spring/summer (November to February). Elusive ghost mushrooms tend to fruit in autumn (March to May) when the temperature cools.\nOne of the most sought-after experiences is paddling through bioluminescence, or bio. \"Everybody wants to see it, and one of the reasons is that it's so Instagrammable. You can swish your feet through it and make sparkles,\" says Finlay. One of the best spots to see a \"blue tide\" in Australia is in Jervis Bay, further along the NSW south coast, or around Hobart in Tasmania.\nChristine Dean Smith is a member of the group who has photographed sea sparkles for more than a decade. \"I hunt for bio because I have skin cancer and I'm banned from daylight,\" she says. \"Being a photographer, you tend to adjust yourself to finding nighttime nature to capture instead and then I show it to my followers.\"\nWhen we've spotted enough nature glowing, we retreat back through the bush to the clearing. Something flashes in my vision under Finlay's fluorescent torch – vivid, electric even; everything I've been told to keep my eyes peeled for. Maybe, I'm getting the hang of hunting for sparkles in the dark.\n\"Nope, just more possum wee,\" Finlay says. "

    "title": "Destination dupes: Where to go instead of the US",
    "content": "As a number of countries issue updated travel advisory information for travel to the US amid tightened restrictions, where can travellers find a similar vibe?\nCitizens of Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and the UK have all heard the same thing in the past few months: if you're planning to travel to the US, the situation has changed. All six governments have issuedupdated travel advicefollowing recent policy changes, drawing attention to a tightening of entry rules and the need for transgender people to declare themselves as male or female on Esta and visa applications.\nAs a result, sentiment is shifting around travel to the Land of the Free.Reports of travellers being detainedat the border over misunderstandings, along with a disturbing spate ofair traffic control failures, have done nothing to increase confidence among travellers. So if you're drawn to the bold landscapes, cultural energy and cinematic atmosphere of the US but are reconsidering your travel plans this year– where can you go instead? From cowboy ranches to vibrant cities and deep canyons, these international alternatives echo the best of the US, with a twist.\nThere's no place like the Big Apple –  or is there? Toronto has long served as a convincing on screen stand-in, doubling for New York in film and television thanks to its eclectic architecture and versatile landscapes along with favourable film-industry incentives. It's so convincing a dupe that it even passed as the city in the Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong filmThe Apprentice, charting Donald Trump's rise to fame in 1970s and '80s Manhattan.\nOf course Toronto is a different and far smaller city to visit: you'll find the Blue Jays not the Yankees on the baseball field here, and a city-wide devotion to poutine, not pizza. However, the parallels run deep. High Park – a 400-acre park with hiking trails and cherry trees – evokes the grandeur of Central Park; while the CN Tower delivers a skyline view to rival the Empire State Building. Even its history aligns: from 1793-1834, Toronto wasn't even called Toronto, it was called York.\n\"Actor Peter Ustinov famously said that Toronto is New York run by the Swiss,\" said Lydia Devereaux, international marketing director at Destination Ontario. \"We've both got world-class museums and galleries, shopping, a renowned food scene inspired by an incredibly diverse population and unique walkable neighbourhoods.\"\nYellowstone has a lot to answer for. The popular Paramount show – along with spin off show 1888 and Beyoncé'sCowboy Carterworld tour – is behind what travel experts have called the rise incowboy core: a growing interest in Western culture, ranch stays and horse-riding holidays. But while Montana and Wyoming are seeing new interest, you don’t have to be in the US to experience the best of cowboy culture: just ask thegauchos(cowboys) of Argentina.\nHere, gaucho culture draws on a centuries-old heritage of nomadic horsemen who care for their livestock and live life in the saddle. While this traditional lifestyle is struggling to survive in the face of agricultural advancement, travellers can stay in a wide array ofestancia(Argentine gaucho ranches) where the pace is slow, the landscapes are vast and the asado (traditional barbecue) is serious business.\n\"AtEstancia Los Potreros, guests witness authentic horsemanship, asados andmatedrinking, which are all still part of daily life,\" said owner Kevin Begg, who believes the Argentinian version of cowboy culture is even more authentic than the US. \"We invite our guests to be part of our family and our activities are all based on what is going on at the estancia as opposed to being picked off an activity list.\"\nThe Grand Canyon's size and scale are unmatched – measuring 278 miles long, 18 miles across at its widest and an average of one mile deep. Its also one of the US'smost visited national parks, with nearly five million visitors last year.\nBut Europe's deepest canyon, the Tara River Gorge in Montenegro, offers a similar sense of awe, without the crowds. Located inDurmitor National Park, the canyon is carved by a ribbon of turquoise-blue water, where whitewater rafters brace for roiling waves beneath sharp-sided cliffs.\n\"It has a powerful sense of isolation and raw beauty that will resonate with anyone who has stood at the edge of the Grand Canyon,\" said Stefanie Schmudde, senior vice president of global product strategy at luxury travel specialistsAbercrombie & Kent. \"The scale is immense, and it offers that same visceral connection to nature in a setting that feels remote and undiscovered.\"\nFrom its famous fog to the Golden Gate Bridge, Silicon Valley and Alcatraz, San Francisco is one of the US' most distinctive cities. It has had starring roles in films including Dirty Harry and Mrs Doubtfire, while helping to shape cultural history in the US and beyond thanks to the 1967 Summer of Love protests against the Vietnam War.\nMore like this:\n•'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\n•The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\n•How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\nBut on the other side of the globe, Cape Town in South Africa channels a similar mood – with its fog-draped coast, significant cultural history and a growing tech scene as well as its very own historic prison island.\nRobben Island, where Nelson Mandela was once imprisoned, is now a museum and a fair dupe for Alcatraz, both being surrounded by shark-infested waters. While you won't meet sea lions on a Cape Town beach as you might in San Francisco, there is a colony of African penguins living atBoulder Beach.\n\"Cape Town is one of those places that truly has something for everyone,\" said Zinzi Bobani, general manager of travel firmIntrepid's Southern Africa office. \"It's a foodie haven with a fusion of cuisines and stunning wineries, beautiful coastal hiking routes and cable car adventures on Table Mountain, and of course rich in history.\"\nAsia's gambling hub, Macau, is a former trading port between China, India and Portugal that's known as thecasino capital of the world. If you're looking for an alternative to the bright lights of glitzy desert city Las Vegas, the \"Vegas of Asia\", as the Chinese special administrative region is often called, could be a great fit.\nJust as in Vegas, visitors to Macau can experience shows and fine dining along with resort-style luxury hotels. While Macau may not have aBellagio, it does have the world's firstKarl Lagerfeld Hotel, a five-star hotel designed by the fashion legend. At the Cotai Strip, you can find replicas of Venice's Grand Canal and a half-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower.\nAndy Eastham of travel firmWendy Wu Tourssays it has the Vegas feel and then a little extra: \"For fans of Vegas, there's plenty that will feel familiar, but where Macau really stands apart is in its cultural depth. One moment you're sipping cocktails in a sky bar, the next you're wandering through cobbled lanes lined with pastel-coloured colonial buildings or watching dragon dancers outside a Taoist temple. It's the only place in China where Portuguese and Chinese cultures truly intertwine.\" "

    "title": "Inside the fortress that inspired Hamlet",
    "content": "As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.\nThere's a cold wind blowing from the Øresund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsingør, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.\nThis windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April);Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take inRupert Goold's productionstarring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2016.\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" – the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure – it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsingør – the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg – but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon – and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer – as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer,special toursinvite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father – but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto – written very early in 1603 – is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsingør.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director ofHamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town'sShakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatreSchaubüneand a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n•Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n•Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n•Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists – but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry – starring a youngClaes Bangas Rosenkrantz – and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed byThe Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said thatevery minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away. "

    "title": "The Indian Ocean's laid-back 'paradise on Earth'",
    "content": "Famous for its adorable quokkas, Rottnest Island has become a global favourite. But beyond the selfies lies a rich, complex story of culture, conservation and community.\nOn a recent visit to Perth, I mentioned to a local that I was heading to Rottnest Island the next day. She sighed wistfully. \"I love it there,\" she said. \"You're going to love it too. It has a special kind of magic – the kind of place where you kick off your shoes the minute you arrive. Everything slows down and you can breathe a little more deeply.\"\nI already felt that Perth was a little like that – at least, life there felt slower and less frenzied than in my hometown of Melbourne on Australia's east coast – but I smiled back, notreallyknowing what she meant.\nHowever, she was right.Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-sq-km isle off the coast of Western Australia, is, in fact, magical. The spell was cast as soon as our ferry left the mainland, skimming over the Indian Ocean. Humpback whales breached nearby, sending jets of sea spray into the air and flipping their tails as if in welcome. The sky was clear with the promise of a perfect day to come.\nJust 19km and 30 minutes later, I stepped off the ferry into another world. Rottnest Island has been famously car-free since 1931, and those more in the know than me immediately jumped onto bikes they'd brought with them or wandered off to hire one from Pedal and Flipper, said to bethe largest bike hire place in the southern hemisphere.\nKids zoomed around in packs, dodging groups of tourists ambling through the main settlement. Some people had fishing rods under one arm; others, surfboards strapped to their bikes. Families stopped at the bakery for a flat white andvanilla slicebefore heading off to explore the island's 63 beaches and 20 bays, many with evocative names likeLittle Parakeet BayandCathedral Rocksthat in no way came close to capturing the grandeur of the scenery in real life.\nThere was no urban noise, no traffic and nothing to worry about. It was idyllic and glorious and everything I imagined a nostalgic care-free (and car-free) island holiday to be.\nThe isle has long been a cherished playground for generations of Western Australian families. \"Rottnest is very, very special, particularly to the people of Perth, like me,\" explained Paul Campbell, a volunteer guide I met not long after I arrived. Campbell spent his childhood holidays on Rottnest and now returns regularly to tell people about his beloved island. \"There are no multi-storey high-rise hotels here,\" he added. \"There is no private ownership. If you ever tried to put a multi-storey-anything here for wealthy people, you would be absolutely torn to shreds. We are very protective of our beautiful island.\"\nOnce a well-kept secret from the rest of the world, in recent years Rottnest has become one of Australia's most Instagrammed destinations, thanks to a certain fuzzy-faced resident: the quokka.\nIn 2013, Huffington Post dubbed the quokka \"the happiest animal in the world\", and the internet responded in glee. Quokkas – tiny marsupials found only in this small pocket of south-western Australia – seem to smile for selfies in a way that feels almost staged. Tennis starRoger Federerto actressMargot Robbiewere among the first celebrities to pose with the infamous animal, helping spark a wave of global attention. Then in 2019 came Chris Hemsworth's now-iconic#QuokkaSelfiewith Matt Damon, which racked up more than four million likes. \"Rotto\", as locals call it, became the hottest ticket in town, transforming from local secret to global sensation. According to the Rottnest Island Authority, annual visitor numbers have nearly tripled in the last decade, peaking at more than 800,000 at last count.\nRottnest, once simple and sleepy, has had to quickly grow up to meet the demands of all these domestic and international tourists. That meant creating more accommodation than the basic cabins and camping that existed, as well as better food and activity options. And what it has done is exemplary, transforming into a model of eco-conscious tourism without losing its soul.\nAs Campbell put it: \"When I was nine years old, the [cultural] experience that I had on Rottnest is not that much different to what you're going to experience today.\"\nYou won't find any private cars here – just a few vehicles for rangers and staff – so most everyone gets about on two wheels or two feet (or the odd skateboard, scooter or Segway), having to occasionally dodge quokkas lounging on the road. Accommodation ranges from beachside cottages with bike racks out front to backpacker dorms to relaxed boutique hotels. While many tourists come on a day trip from Perth, it's much better to stay the night: quokkas are nocturnal and will spend most of the day sleeping under shady bushes. In addition, most day-trippers leave by 16:30, at which point the island truly comes into its own.\n\"Someone once said to me that you can feel the island exhale [when they leave],\" said Erin Gallagher from the Rottnest Island Authority. \"I just thought it was the most beautiful thing – and it's so true.\"\nI was staying atDiscovery Resorts, the island's first eco resort, whose 83 glamping tents are shaded by gum trees and Aleppo pines, tucked behindPinky Beachin the sand dunes. My tent had no aircon or TV, just a ceiling fan for airflow and the sound of the ocean through canvas walls. It was perfect in its simplicity. \"[The resort] is designed to immerse guests into the environment,\" explained Krizza Miclat, the resort's sales and event manager. \"A lot of the infrastructure is elevated on steel poles to ensure that we're not damaging the sand dunes. So, if ever we were to pick up and move, we haven't impacted it too much.\"\nIn fact, nearly everything here works in harmony with the natural environment. Renewable energy is provided by the Indian Ocean's sea breezes and the strong Western Australian sun; while drinking water is drawn from the sweeping white semi-circle ofLongreach Bay, desalinated and filtered.Marine sanctuary zonesbelow water mean world-class snorkelling and diving, and anisland nurserygrows native plants from locally sourced cuttings and seeds. In 2023, a newmanagement planreaffirmed Rottnest's commitment to sustainability, conservation and culture.\n\"We're always striving to improve,\" said Gallagher. \"Our target is to achieve 75% renewables. There's even an app where anyone can see how much power the island is generating in real time.\"\nMore like this:\n•A day out with Bluey: Australia's new experience brings the Heeler family to life\n•Bindi Irwin's top outdoor adventures in Australia\n•The hike making Australia a better place\nIn the spirit of low-impact activities, I decided to take a Segway tour around the undulating landscape, rolling along the endless beaches, gliding past the cluster of salt lakes in the north-eastern corner and looking out for whales on the island'sHumpback Highway. I steered past the scrub heath that covers much of the island, breathing in its signature salty-sweet smell and dodging prickle lily and feather speargrass. The island is just 11km long and 4.5km at its widest point, but its biodiversity is vast – a Class A reserve where everything from the blue-flowered Rottnest daisy to the long, black king skink I saw on the side of a trail is protected.\nBut not all scenes here are so idyllic.\nIn 1838, Rottnest was turned into an Aboriginal prison. Over the next century, more than 4,000 Indigenous men and boys were incarcerated here for \"crimes\" that they often didn't know they'd committed. Some were as young as eight years old. Many never returned home.\nIt's a dark legacy that the island is only beginning to address. As I wobbled my Segway back to the main settlement, we passed what looked like an ordinary field. But, my tour guide explained, it is a place of immense significance: theWadjemup Aboriginal Burial Groundwhere 373 unmarked graves of prisoners were uncovered, with the first discoveries made during construction work in the 1970s. Shockingly, holidaymakers continued to camp on the site until the practice was finally banned in 2007.\n\"It was the largest number of Aboriginal deaths in custody in history in Australia,\" explained volunteer guide Anne Yardley, when I met her later at the island'sWadjemup Museum. \"And from the biggest number of Aboriginal nations.\"\nBut Indigenous connection to the island stretches far beyond this painful chapter. Long before European settlement, the island was part of the mainland, and archaeological evidence shows that the Noongar people lived on and used the island for tens of thousands of years. Its Indigenous name – Wadjemup – means \"place of spirits\".\n\"This was a significant place for Indigenous people,\" Campbell told me. \"Ceremonies were held here. But about 6,500 years ago, sea levels rose and this patch of land became an island. The Aboriginal people stayed on the mainland and it was left alone for thousands of years… all through Christianity, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire… until Europeans arrived.\"\nToday, Wadjemup is working to tell this fuller story. The small but compelling Wadjemup Museum has been revamped; while walking trails such as the 45kmWadjemup Bidi– made up of five connected trails and built in part by volunteers – connects visitors to historical and cultural sites across the landscape, with interpretive signage and installations by Noongar artists. TheWadjemup Project, an Aboriginal-led initiative, focusses on acknowledging Wadjemup's history of Aboriginal incarceration and the memorialisation of former prison sites.\nVolunteers play a huge part, too, from the Winnit Club, formed in 1931 by a group of regular campers, to the yellow-shirted Rottnest Volunteer Guides. These and other groups collectively contribute more than 40,000 hours a year to maintaining the island, and their dedication to preserving and sharing its stories speaks volumes about how deeply the island is loved.\n\"There's this balancing act between having enough people to make the place work financially, but not so many people coming here that you lose the reason to come,\" said Campbell. \"It is a very, very special place.\"\nI certainly felt that on my visit. One moment I was riding my bike past salt lakes ringed with grey saltbush and coastal pigface, the next watching irresistibly cute quokkas hop around at sunset. I snorkelled an underwater trail through turquoise shallows, gazed onto shipwrecks just offshore and had sunset drinks looking out to incredible ocean vistas. I even tried to get my own quokka selfie, respecting the signs not to feed or touch them in any way but to keep my distance and let them come to me. I laughed as I tried – and failed – to get both myself and a quokka fully in shot, and was reminded of something Gallagher had said to me about the smiling-faced marsupial: \"Why wouldn't you be happy if this is where you lived?\"\nIt was more than just a line – it was a truth that settled into the bones of the island. Rottnest may be famous now, but it hasn't lost what makes it feel like a local secret: the sense that once you arrive, you can slow down, breathe deeply and kick off your shoes for a while. "

    "title": "Islas Marías: A notorious prison island turned natural paradise",
    "content": "In 2019, Mexico's Islas Marías prison – the last island penal colony in the Americas – finally closed. Now a biosphere reserve, the once-feared archipelago is open to tourists on restricted, navy-organised tours.\nI was at the ferry port in San Blas, a coastal town in western Mexico's Nayarit state, when two men wearing fatigues and carrying machine guns passed me in the queue. Next came a guard leading an Alsatian, which diligently sniffed my backpack. Along with a few hundred middle-aged Mexican tourists, I was about to board a weekend tour organised by the Mexican navy to María Madre, the largest island in the Islas Marías archipelago – once known as the \"Alcatraz of Mexico\".\nUnbeknownst to me at the time, my trip came just before US President Trump ordered his government toreopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco whose operations were formally shuttered in 1963. Alcatraz has since become a major tourist attraction where visitors can experience the historic cellhouse as it once was, and Mexico's own notorious former prison similarly allows tourists to peruse its cells. Unlike Alcatraz, however, the Mexican island has been transformed into a remarkable place of conservation.\nLocated about 130km from the Mexican mainland, María Madre spans around 145 sq km and is part of a four-island nature reserve that's now managed by Mexico's navy. Since 2022, tourists have been allowed to visit via four-hour ferry trips from San Blas and Mazatlán city, exploring designated areas under supervision.\nFor many Mexicans, Islas Marías needs no introduction. The prison, founded in 1905, housed mass murderers and was the setting for the prolific Mexican director Emilio Fernández's 1951 film Las Islas Marías.\n\"They used to have the big shots here, the big criminals,\" said fellow passenger Francisco Espinosa, who told me was drawn to the tour by the film, which shows the island's beaches and salt flats that prisoners worked on. \"It's like Alcatraz. Everybody knew about this prison.\"\nThe island is prone to extreme wind and a military base operates there, so we were compelled to watch a safety video about what to do if the island suffers a tsunami or gas attack (for the latter, cover your nose and run). After the video, I glimpsed huge sea turtles breaching the ocean surface from the ferry window.\nThe natural spectacle continued after we walked over María Madre's concrete jetty and dropped our bags in the hotel complex created for the new visitors. Herds of wild goats scattered from the pathways between restaurant buffet buildings and little gift shops as the incoming humans interrupted their wandering. The sound of hooves on concrete dovetailed with the burble of water crashing from a large waterfall-style water feature, plus loud squawks emanating from trees overhead.\nOne of our guides explained that the squawks signalled mating season for the green Tres Marías amazon parrots that are endemic to the island. Prisoners used to get family members to smuggle these prized parrots to the mainland, to sell. The boa population also took a hit as prisoners caught snakes to make belts from their skin.\nI was assigned an airy, white-painted villa, which guides said used to house prisoners. They explained that some prisoners were allowed to have their families live with them on the island and could roam relatively freely. However, life wasn't open and breezy for all, with many forced to work in sweltering heat on salt flats or shrimp farms. In 2022 an ex-prisoner told theLos Angeles Timesthat she remembered five bathrooms being shared by 500 female prisoners. \"We lived in a chicken coop,\" she said.\nBut in 2010, when the prison was still open, Unesco declaredIslas Marias a biosphere reserve, noting the biological wealth found in the \"dry forests of its landscape, in the mangroves, the succulent rosette scrubland, the reefs, coasts and pelagic environments it harbours\". As well as the contraband parrots, the island is home to 18 other endemic species, including raccoons and rabbits. Mexico's National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) is charged with protecting the delicate ecosystem, which developed in isolation for more than eight million years, while the navy-run tours take visitors through the abandoned prison buildings and educates them on the flora and fauna.\n\"This is tourism for excursions, to explore, to live with nature,\" said Mexico's then-president Lopez Obrador in 2022. \"What was a hell is becoming a paradise.\"\nStill, most tourists come for the history, not the animals. I joined a group hike where our guide pointed out a rusty metal structure near a cliff edge. It looked like a sentry box but was in fact a torture cabinet for errant prisoners, positioned to become hellishly heated by the morning Sun. Tourists took turns climbing inside and pulling its squeaky door shut.\nAfter a buffet meal soundtracked by piped saxophone renditions of Elton John songs, a bus took us over dusty roads to the former maximum-security prison complex. As we approached the vast grey buildings, past fencing topped with rolls of barbed wire, Macarena blasted from the bus speakers.\nIn 2006, after the Mexican government declared war against the country's drug cartels, the prison island changed from a relatively \"open\" prison to a more standard penitentiary. In 2011, a maximum-security section opened with a design based on US prisons: shiny steel tables, chairs and toilets, clanking metal doors and small cells with bunk beds. Fellow tourists thrust their arms between metal bars, posing for photos. Our guide said that there was a riot here in 2013 due to prisoners being riled about rations, and the section shuttered soon afterwards. Now wild goats canter between the unmanned watch towers.\nBut before the island housed a high-security prison, it served as a place of exile for petty criminals and \"undesirables\". President Álvaro Obregón began shipping political opponents here in 1910, and in the 1920s, it housed Catholic supporters rounded up in the Cristero War (1926-29).\nOne of its most notable political prisoners was writer and activist José Revueltas, who was sent to the island twice in the 1930s. He was a member of the Mexican Communist Party declared illegal by the government and was convicted after attending a union strike. A mural of the bespectacled, long-goateed Revueltas adorns the wall of the hotel check-in building.\nLater, the bus took us to a Sun-blasted graveyard flanked by huge cacti, where we paused by a white cross. This was the tomb of José Ortiz Muñoz – known as \"El Sapo aka The Toad\" – an alleged former government assassin who was brought to the island in the 1960s after reportedly killing hundreds of people. He was murdered by fellow prisoners wielding machetes. A guide pulled out her phone to playEl Sapo, a jaunty song by the singer Chalino Sánchez. An iguana skittered from the neighbouring tomb's surface, its tail disappearing under tiles.\nMore like this:\n•Mexico's controversial new 'superhighway'\n•Brazil's prison island turned paradise\n•Pachucos: The Latinx subculture that defied the US\nReports from former Islas Marías residents suggest that less well-known killings also took place on the islands. In 2004, an island chaplain named Francisco Ornelaswrote: \"It is rumoured – and rumours are a profession here – that people who were disappeared are buried on the other three islands, which are now deserted but for the visits of illegal fishermen and drug traffickers.\"\nAccess to the waters around Islas Marías was restricted after María Madre became a penal colony in 1905. Fishing was further limited in 2000 when the area was declared a bioreserve by Mexican authorities, ahead of Unesco's declaration in 2010. In 2021, fishing restrictions were tightened again, with all commercial fishing without a permit from the navy banned in the area.\nHowever, conservationists say that illegal fishing hasn't been effectively cracked down on by authorities. Octavio Aburto-Oropeza, a marine conservationist and professor at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, echoed this when I spoke to him after the tour. \"I know companies that offer not only recreational fishing [around Islas Marías], also spear fishing,\" he said.\nAburto-Oropeza has dived the waters around Islas Marías on two separate trips, and says that while illegal fishing remains a concern, the reefs and wider marine ecosystem are in good shape, largely due to the archipelago's isolation and low visitor numbers.\nHe believes that the navy and CONANP should do more to tackle illegal fishing and set tangible goals for reef and species restoration, but that responsible tourism could also help. \"You can create a vision of tourism on the reefs with a certain capacity,\" he said. \"Touristic activities, especially diving, could help enforce conservation projects.\"\nI hope to return – perhaps to dive, or explore more land sites. A guide showed me photos of buildings that are currently off-limits, including derelict rooms filled with quirky octopus sculptures made by prisoners. In time these buildings might be certified safe to visit, she said.\nOn the ferry back to San Blas, I chatted to fellow passengers about parrots, torture boxes and the surreal experience of stepping into \"Mexico's Alcatraz\". Not one said the prison should re-open. "

    "title": "A weekend in Cannes with an attaché to the stars",
    "content": "Gilles Bastoni is Cannes' celebrity concierge. Here is his tailor-made list for a sublime Cannes getaway – from luxurious star-studded venues to escapes at sea.\nEvery May since 1946, the red carpet has been rolled out onto Cannes' palm-lined boulevards for itsInternational Film Festival, turning the French Riviera resort city into a playground for silver screen stars.\nMuch like the celebrities it attracts, Cannes isn't camera shy: it's a postcard-perfect town bursting with fuchsia bougainvillea and resplendent ivory-hued facades. And as its palatial grand hotels show, the town has been a magnet for the elite long before the dawn of film – prior to entertaining Hollywood royalty, it was the haunt of European nobility.\nThe 2025 edition of the Film Festival, taking place 13-24 May, will bring a set of well-known A-listers, fromTom Cruiseto Robert De Niro, who will recceive the Honorary Palme d'Or for Lifetime Achievement. But you don't need to be of blue blood or billed in a Hollywood blockbuster to enjoy a VIP experience in this jewel-like Côte d'Azur holiday town.\nWe spoke to Gilles Bastoni, the Cannes born-and-bred head concierge of the city's iconic, five-starHôtel Barrière Le Majestic, which is opposite the main venue of the Film Festival and hosts its main VIPs.\nKnown as the \"concierge of the stars\", Bastoni was raised on Cannes' glam. \"My father was head concierge of Le Majestic,\" he says. \"You could say I was nearly born in the hotel.\"\nAs Cannes' celebrity concierge, Bastoni knows a thing or two about demanding clients – and going the extra mile to fulfil their needs.\n\"As a concierge, you always have to be on top of things,\" he says. \"You have to change things again and again, to answer all guests' requests and satisfy them. One time, one celebrity guest forgot their dress in Paris and we had to go pick it up. Another time, we had a very big celebrity who wanted to have a birthday party for their spouse on the boat, and when things didn't work, we needed to find a backup.\" The outcome? \"They became a confidante in the end.\"\nHere are Bastoni's A-list ways to experience Cannes in its full beauty, whether or not you have an invite to the Film Festival.\nFew places better encapsulate the cinematic grandeur of Cannes than its seafront promenade:La Croisette.\n\"La Croisette is incredible,\" Bastoni says, barely able to contain his enthusiasm. \"It's 1km long, full of luxurious brands, beaches and hotels. There aren't many places in the world where you can find such a concentration of luxury.\"\nDesigned in the 19th Century by a British aristocrat, La Croisette is a masterclass of Art Nouveau architecture, with its row of grand hotels — from Bastoni's own Majestic to theJW Marriott,Carlton CannesandHôtel Martinez— as well as luxury boutiques, plush cafes and even shops reselling celebrity memorabilia.\nThe film industry's legacy is palpable here –150 stars' footprints can be found on the promenade.\n\"Come Film Festival, [La Croisette]'s vibe is totally different,\" Bastoni says. \"The road is packed; you have open-air cinemas on the beach.\"\nAddress: Palace of Festivals and Congresses of Cannes, 1 Boulevard de la Croisette 06400\nWebsite:https://www.palaisdesfestivals.com\nPhone number: +33 4 92 99 84 00\nInstagram:@palaisdesfestivals\nCannes may now be synonymous with the glitterati, but it remains a demure Provençal fishing village at its core, and nowhere is this more evident than atLe Suquet, its pocket-sized old town.\nCrowning the bay, Le Suquet is a tight-knit complex of pastel-hued alleyways topped by a castle and church, both built in the 12th Century. In the harbour, small fishing boats and mansion-sized mega yachts glide side by side.\nIt's a welcome break from the brazen opulence of La Croisette. \"Here, you see what Cannes really is,\" Bastoni says. \"It started off as a small fishing town. Everything else was built around it. You still have fisherman in [Le Suquet's] old port.\"\nUp the quarter's cobblestone streets, Le Suquet's Gothic monastery-château and church ofNôtre-Dame-de-l'Espéranceprovide a unique vantage point from which to take in Cannes' panorama.\n\"You can see the sea, the islands. It's a spectacular view,\" Bastoni says.\nAnd for all the energy burnt trekking up to its summit, Le Suquet does not leave its visitors on an empty stomach; its Meynadier Street features delicatessens, restaurants and cafes that have belonged to local families for generations.\nBastoni's pick? \"Le Maschou,\" he says.  \"It's the best restaurant for local food. It's a lowkey place [typical] of the old town.\"\nAddress: Restaurant Le Maschou, 15 Rue Saint-Antoine, 06400\nWebsite:https://www.lemaschou.com/en/\nPhone number: +33 4 93 39 62 21\nInstagram:@lemaschou\nAt the foot of Le Suquet is Cannes' beating heart: theMarché Forville(Forville Market)\n\"You'll want to go see the old town's market,\" Bastoni says, to truly get the feel of the Côte d'Azur life and step into a local's shoes.\nOver in Forville, a sturdy, orange-coloured edifice, the wafting scent of garlic and parsley mix with the catch of the day.\nWhile French cuisine is typically renowned for its fussy, buttery profile, the food of the Côte d'Azur – as Bastoni notes – has a leaner, more fragrant note.\n\"Ours is a Mediterranean cuisine,\" Bastoni says. \"We don't have a lot of heavy, creamy food.

But it's also renowned for its Mediterranean-Asian fusion food, made by Greek chefYannis Kioroglou.\nWith an entrance fee of €55 Medusa isn't for those on a budget. And younger clientele may eschew Medusa for hip clubs likeBâoliandBisous Bisous,which play house music.\nBut Medusa, for Bastoni, remains iconic, for one reason: \"It's the cabaret show,\" he says, which starts as the restaurant metamorphoses into a club.\nAnd it's not just any cabaret.

    "title": "Chriselle Lim's self-care guide will have you googling flights to Seoul",
    "content": "She jets around the world for her high-profile beauty career, but her heart is in Seoul. Here are her top K-beauty experiences in town, from face lasers to body scrubs.\nFor Chriselle Lim – style guru,digital creatorand creative director ofPHLURfragrances – self-care is a way of life. Especially when she visits South Korea, the birthplace of the viral \"K-beauty\"–  beloved for its multi-layer \"glass skin\" skincare regimens and high-tech sun creams.\n\"Beauty and self-care in Korea is a daily thing,\" says the fresh-faced and flawlessly stylish Lim, who spent her formative years in the glamorous South Korean capital and returns with her daughters each year. \"It's not about hitting a certain age and then taking care of your skin. You just do it since you're a very young girl. As we're trying to reverse [sun damage] here in the States, in Korea, the women have been taught to protect themselves early on. We were always embarrassed about our moms taking us around in their crazy massive sun hats and their gloves. But now I get it. I've become that lady.\"\nWhile innovative Korean products likecollagen sheet maskscontinue to dominate the international market, Korea is also seeing an uptick inbeauty tourism.Consumers can visit \"skin clinics\" for medical aesthetic treatments powered by ultra-modern Korean technologies; often not yet approved by the FDA. Adding to the appeal, patients can get several treatments – from Botox toTitanium skin liftingtoliquid laser sun spot removal– in one sitting with jaw-dropping transformations and little downtime – compared to Western protocols, which require patients wait 28 days between treatments.\n\"I have a lot of followers that ask me for tips and where to go,\" says Lim. \"It makes a lot of sense. One, the technology is there. And two, it's so much cheaper [than the US], at least by five times. The flight there, renting an Airbnb or a hotel; it actually makes a lot of sense because you are saving money in the long run.\"\nNot that Lim ever needs a reason to visit Seoul. \"It's a fast-paced city that is extremely clean, chic, sophisticated,\" she says. \"Just imagine fashion and art and beauty all combined in one. It's one of those places I go whenever I'm feeling like I need inspiration.\"\nHere is Lim's go-to plan for a self-care holiday in Seoul.\nGangnam, the stylish district made world-famous by acertain 2012 K-pop song, is consideredSeoul's K-beauty and medical tourism hot spot– and it's where Lim's self-care holidays start. First stop:Eun Skin Clinicin the affluent Cheongdam neighbourhood, south of the Han River.\n\"They do incredible lasers, the best I've experienced,\" says Lim. \"They speak really good English there, which is a big make or break for me because I'm not fluent in Korean. And because [the doctor] deals with a lot of English-speaking people, I think she realises that a lot of them are here to explore and have fun, so she doesn't want to be so aggressive with their face. They do a very customised approach.\"\nKorean skin lasers, notes Lim, are so gentle they can even be layered on top of each other to compound their transformative effects.\n\"It's very, very gentle,\" says Lim of her most recent visit. \"I did something calledRubytoning; helps with even skin tone and brightening. And there's another laser that I did calledMeDioStar®, which is brightening and tightening. And then on top of that, I didPRP[platelet-rich plasma treatment]. And then I also didmicroneedlingand thensalmon DNA. It takes maybe an hour and a half to do.\"\nShe cautions:  \"The next day, if you get five to eight treatments, your skin will be slightly bruised, but it goes away within, I would say, 48 hours. [These lasers are] effective on the deeper surface level, but on the topical level, you can't really tell that you've gotten anything done… But then after I went home, and people were like, 'Wait, did you, did you do something to your face? ' And you're like, 'Okay, I think it's kicking in'.\"\nLim recommends visitors hit skin clinics at the beginning of their trip – \"first thing when they land… because these clinics like to check up on you after three-to-five days. During that downtime, you could do coffee and check out some incredible museums and do some shopping.\"\nWebsite:www.eunskin.co.kr/\nAddress: 88-37 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2 546 3322\nInstagram:@eunskinclinic/\nAs part of her downtime from skin procedures, Lim also likes to indulge in relaxing body treatments.\n\"There's this spa calledGogyeol,\" says Lim. \"I love this place to reset my body. They do a traditional Korean massage and scrub.\"\nLike Eun Skin Clinic, Spa Gogyeol is found in Cheongdam; a two-minute walk from the Gangnam-Gu Office metro station. Lim notes that Spa Gogyeol is a not ajjimjilbang(a public Korean bathhouse). \"A lot of people love Korean bathhouses [because] they do this intensive scrub where they literally scrub off all the dead cells off your skin and it just comes purging off your body. It's pretty disgusting. But [Spa Gogyeol does] that treatment in a private setting, so you can get the body scrub, the upgrade massage and a detox wrap. They literally scrub off every dead skin cell on your body, and it just feels so soft. You feel like you're floating.\"\nSpa Gogyeol also offers a rich menu of holistic medical treatments, working with the body'sfive Tae energies. \"In Korean health, a lot of it is about balance,\" says Lim. \"So they'll really analyse your body to see what they need to focus on, and they'll customise it for you.\n\"I think a lot of people that are on holiday just want to relax,\" she adds. \"A lot of tired mamas. It's a very calming space.\"\nWebsite:https://spa-gogyeol.com/\nAddress: 3F&4F, 13, Seolleung-ro 132-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea\nPhone: +82 10-7682-1297\nInstagram:@spa_gogyeol\nWhere Eun Skin Clinic is expressly high tech and Spa Gogyeol takes a holistic approach, Lim's next spa pick –Trinity Spain Seoul's Yongsan District –  is all about pampering and beautification.\n\"It's a little tricky with Trinity spa because their English isn't the best,\" says Lim. \"But I think they're working on it. They're more of a general spa; that's why I feel okay recommending it. They do everything from amazing facials, really focussing on lifting the face and focussing on your lines, and brightening and tightening to body contouring, massages. They cover it all.\"\nTrinity Spa's array of facial and body treatments toe the line between technology and relief – like the Real Jade Stone V-line jaw contour treatment or the lymphatic drainage leg massages – all administered in private guest rooms with cushy spa beds designed for ultimate relaxation.\n\"It's just a very relaxing experience for someone that wants a general spa experience,\" says Lim.\nWebsite:www.trinityspa.co.kr/\nAddress: 3rd floor, Taeseok Building 116 Dokseodang-ro, Hannam-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-420-0797\nInstagram:@the_trinityspa_official/\nThe Korean skincare craze began in the early 2010s; global cosmetic purveyor Sephora's website now features aK-beauty sectionand Lim herself often providesK-beauty product recommendationson social media.\nSo when in Korea, shop as the Koreans do.\n\"Everyone needs to go toAmorepacific World Headquarters,\" declares Lim. Known as the inventor of thecushion foundation, Amorepacific now also owns many popular Korean skincare companies includingSulwhasoo,Innisfree,CosrxandLaneige. \"It's open to the public, which a lot of people don't know,\" says Lim. \"In their lobby, you can get your face scanned; a lot of people go there to get their cushion foundation customised… they have a beauty store in their lobby, so you can experience all of their brands at once. [There's also] an interactive Amorepacific store calledAMORE Seongsu. It's in this warehouse-y cement building; it's like you're walking through a store, but with a bathroom installation in front of you while you try things. Everything is technology-driven; you can get customised lip treatments, customised foundation. I could spend hours there.\"\nLim adds: \"There's also theSulwhasoo flagship store, which is just beautiful in itself.\"\nSulwhasoo, a luxury skin line, is headquartered in Seoul's upscale shopping district Sinsa-dong, in a modular structure channelling a golden lantern. \"The shopping is great, and it looks like you're entering an installation,\" says Lim. \"It has two spas. You could have, like, a foot scrub [or] a therapist with the singing bowl around your abdomen.\"\nLim also enjoys shopping for her favourite Korean brands at Olive Young. \"It's the Sephora of Korea,\" she says. \"They're on every corner. But the key thing is to know which one to go to. There'sone in Myeongdong, which is the largest. Then thenewest one is in Seongsuand it's a lot more tech-driven.\" Apart from beauty shopping, the five-storey Olive Young in Seongsu houses a cafe and a skin and scalp clinic as well as professional makeup services and a \"trend pod\" showroom. \"Olive Young can be slightly outdated depending which one you go to,\" says Lim. \"But this one feels like the future of what Olive Young will be.\"\nWebsite:https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/our-culture/amorepacific-space/amorepacific-headquarters/amorepacific-headquarters.html(Amorepacific World Headquarters)\nAddress: 100 Hangang-daero, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-604-05114\nInstagram:@amorepacificgroup.official/\nWebsite:https://www.amoremall.com/kr/ko/store/display?storeCode=001(Amorepacific Seongsu)\nAddress: 7 Achasan-ro 11-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-469-8600\nWebsite:https://www.sulwhasoo.com/int/en/flagship/dosan/index.html(Sulwhasoo flagship)\nAddress: 18 Dosan-daero 45-gil, Sinsa-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2-541-9270\nInstagram:@sulwhasoo.official/\nWebsite:https://global.oliveyoung.com/(Olive Young Seongsu)\nAddress: 300-65 Seongsu-dong 2(i)-ga, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone:+82 2-461-5290\nInstagram:@oliveyoung_global/\nTo cap off a day of beauty, Lim heads straight for the hair salon. \"This is actually quite common in Korea,\" she says. \"After you get all your skin treatments, you go get your hair done.\"\nLim favoursABYBOM, a massive, three-storey salon on Seolleung-ro that boasts a client roster of Korean celebs likeSandara Park. \"A lot of people that go to events get the full service of hair and makeup done,\" says Lim. \"They do amazing cuts. They style, they detoxify your scalp, if needed. They're incredible.\"\nAfterwards, Lim always likes to visit a café. \"Café life in Korea is so major,\" she says. \"Between cafés and skin, you will never see the end of day.\" One of her favourite stops is inside the Dosan ParkGentle Monsterbranch; 35 minutes outside of Seoul proper. \"Gentle Monster is a sunglass brand; they have the coolest shops ever,\" says Lim. \"It's like an art installation. Then downstairs, there is a cafe calledNudake;they have conceptual coffees and baked goods.\"\nNudake Café proffers itscoffees and whimsical pastries on stark countertops, like modern art displays. \"It sounds so ridiculous, but they have these tiny, tiny, tiny, miniature croissants,\" says Lim. \"They're literally the size of your pinky nail bed, but it's so good, and it's just so fun to take a photo with. [And] they have incredible coffee. It's actually quite hard to find non-dairy milks, but they have non-dairy milk there. So that's personally the reason why I like to go to that café, to just get my lattes without dairy milk.\"\n\"There's a lot of things that we have been doing in Korea that I feel like the world is finally noticing,\" adds Lim. \"It's something that I'm very proud of.\"\nWebsite:www.abybom.com/\nAddress: 3층, 40 Seolleung-ro 152-gil, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: + 82-2-516-8765\nInstagram:@abybom__official/reels/\nWebsite:https://nudake.com/en\nAddress: 26 Seongsui-ro 7-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-7-041-284408\nInstagram:@nu_dake/\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "Where to get New York City's best Chinese food",
    "content": "Proud New Yorker chef Calvin Eng is known for his daring reinterpretations of Chinese cuisine. Here's where he goes when he wants homestyle Chinese food, from dim sum to egg tarts.\nThough itsoriginal Chinatownin Lower Manhattan – dating to the 1870s – is the most well-known, New York City is actually home to nine official Chinatowns spread across its five boroughs; each reflecting the rich regional diversity of Chinese cuisine.\nThe city's first Chinatown took root when Chinese immigrants, many from southern China, arrived either directly or relocated from the US's West Coast,fleeing anti-Chinese sentiment. Early businesses were mostly rice shops and teahouses, but by the early 1900s, full-service restaurants emerged, drawing curious diners from all over New York. By the mid-20th Century, Chinese food, in all its glorious forms, had become as associated with New York City as thehumble bagelorthe New York slice.\nAmong the new generation carrying this legacy forward is chefCalvin Eng, the owner ofBonnie's; a Cantonese American restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that has been lauded for its inventive interpretations of Cantonese cuisine. Eng grew up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, learning to cook the food of Guangdong (formerly known as Canton) from his mother, the eponymous Bonnie. Weekends were spent visiting his grandparents on Bayard Street in New York City's Lower Manhattan Chinatown, where he developed a deep connection to the neighbourhood and its food.\n\"There's just so much good food in such a small area,\" Eng says. \"You learn what's worth lining up for and what's best eaten on a subway platform.\" These days, Eng gets his Cantonese fix at a variety of New York's Chinatowns, from Sunset Park to Bensonhurst, each offering its own take on Chinese flavours – from the seafood-heavy dishes of Guangdong to the bold, spicy flavours of Sichuan and Hunan.\nDespite the breadth of regional styles found across the city, Eng's focus remains rooted in the cuisine of southern China. Unlike other styles,Cantonese foodis known for its lightness and simplicity, emphasising fresh ingredients, particularly seafood – a reflection of the region's coastal geography. Heavy spices are rare, and rice – not wheat – is the dominant starch.\n\"Cantonese food is very low on acid and heat,\" Eng explains. \"We use minimal ingredients that allow the main ingredients to shine.\"\nHere are Eng's favourite places to get Chinese food in New York City.\nInsiders know that in Chinatowns across the world, some of the most unassuming places have the best food.Yi Ji Shi Mo– a tiny, below-street-level hole-in-the-wall on Lower Manhattan's Elizabeth Street – is no exception. Here, the specialty is made-to-ordercheung fun;Cantonese-style steamed rice rolls filled with shrimp, beef, pork and other savoury ingredients.\nCheung fun can be found all over New York City's Chinatowns, but Eng says what makes the offerings at Yi Ji Shi Mo stand out is their rice wrapper: it's perfectly thin with a satisfying chew and bounce. \"They mill the rice into flour fresh every morning to make the batter,\" he explains. \"Then they steam it, fill it, roll it up, pop it in a takeout box, give you a packet of their seasoned soy sauce, and you're on your way.\"\nEng eats cheung fun for breakfast, lunch or just a snack whenever he's in the area. The wait can be a bit long since everything is made fresh, but he says it's worth it – or you can try calling ahead. \"My go-to is always the large – which isn't even that large – with beef, scallion and cilantro,\" he says. \"And I just douse it in their soy sauce.\"\nAddress: 88 Elizabeth Street, New York, NY 10013\nPhone: +1 646-233-6311\nA little slice of Xinjian, an autonomous region in north-western China, can be found at the iconicGrand Street Skewer Carton Lower Manhattan's Grand Street.\nThe vendors are a husband-and-wife duo who prepare Xinjian-style meat skewers (yang rou chuan) straight out of a cooler; you can smell the sizzling aroma of roasted lamb and spicy cumin from over a block away, says Eng. \"I don't know what their schedule is, but when they're there, it's a treat, like a special surprise,\" he says. \"If it's raining, snowing or even just a little cold, they're probably not going to be there. But when the weather's nice, you have to take the chance and go.\"\nThe cart is set up just outside a busy train station, and like many commuters, Eng buys a bunch of the inexpensive skewers to eat on the subway ride home to Brooklyn. The selection is impressive: lamb, beef, chicken, fish balls, mushrooms, onions, leeks – even aubergine. \"Whether you get it spicy or not is up to you,\" Eng says, \"but the spicy skewers are very, very tasty.\"\n\"The cart is really special and unique – you don't find anything like it in Chinatown,\" he adds. \"Restaurants aren't doing this kind of thing because it's live fire and not easy to pull off. Getting to experience that on the street is very cool.\"\nAddress: Corner of Grand St and Chrystie Street, New York, NY 10002\nThe Chinese banquet experience is a joyful multi-course feast typically shared at big, round tables to celebrate birthdays, weddings or even just a fun night out with friends. Eng's go-to for a classic banquet isHop Leeon Mott Street; a beloved Chinatown institution since 1973, with all the essentials: oversized tables, lazy Susans and a vast menu.\n\"They have the old-school stuff you can't get all in one place anymore,\" Eng says. Highlights include razor clams in black bean sauce, honey walnut shrimp and a wide variety of chicken dishes: half, whole, poached, fried. But one dish in particular stands out to Eng: the eternally popular Cantonese lobster with pork.\n\"It starts with the Chinese trinity of ginger, garlic and scallions,\" Eng explains. The lobster is broken down Chinese-style, which means it's chopped into 14 easy-to-eat pieces, so there's no need for cracking shells. \"The flavours of the trinity really come through in the wok,\" he says, \"and they stir-fry it with ground pork, which adds this whole extra layer of depth that most lobster dishes just don't have. It's delicious.\"\nWebsite:www.hopleenyc.com/\nAddress: 16 Mott Street, New York, NY 10013\nPhone: +1 212-962-6475\nInstagram:@hop_lee_nyc/\nThroughout the winding streets of Manhattan's Chinatown, roast ducks, chickens and slabs of pork hang in steamy restaurant windows. For Eng,King's Kitchenstands out for serving the best of these iconic barbecued meats. With multiple locations across Manhattan and Brooklyn, the purveyor offers a vast menu, including dim sum, but it's the roasted meats that keep Eng coming back.\n\"Thechar siu(roast pork) is perfectly balanced – sweet and salty, charred and glistening because it's always fresh,\" he says. The marinade, a blend that includes bean paste and Chinese five-spice, is rubbed inside the cavity of the pig, giving the meat deep, rich flavour all the way through.\n\"King's Kitchen does steady business, so they're popping out fresh things all the time,\" Eng adds. \"This way you know the meat is not just sitting there all day.\"\nWebsite:kingskitchenusa.com/\nAddress: 92 East Broadway, New York, NY 10002\nPhone: +1 212-966-7288\nInstagram:@jinhuanggroup/\nWhen he's in the mood for seafood, Eng heads to Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighbourhood to hitBK Seafood Market– a large restaurant with rows of bubbling tanks filled with live fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Diners can pick exactly what they want and have it cooked to order, just minutes from tank to table.\n\"It's a rare opportunity to eat something that was literally swimming two minutes before it was cooked,\" says Eng. One of his favourite orders is king crab prepared three ways, a \"massive feast of king crab\", he says.\nHe also chooses a fresh whole fish and asks for it steamed with soy sauce, ginger and spring onions. \"When the seafood is this fresh, you don't want to ruin it,\" he says. \"Steaming keeps it clean and simple and that's how you taste how good it really is.\"\nWebsite:www.bkseafoodmarketnyc.com/\nAddress: 842 64th St, Brooklyn, NY 11220\nPhone: +1 718-836-6888\nInstagram:@bkseafoodmarket1/\n\"If I want the full dim sum experience, I go for a big location – a place with, like, 1,000 seats,\" says Eng. For that, he heads toPark Asia; a sprawling two-storey space with high ceilings and a bright, bustling vibe. \"It's where I had my son's 100-day party [a celebration marking a child's first 100 days in Chinese culture] with 100 people,\" he says.\nFor Eng, the ideal dim sum restaurant offers the most variety. \"When I get dim sum from a cart, I want a lot of different things on the table,\" he says. And the key to a good spot? \"It should be packed. That means the food's fresh, and nothing's been sitting on the cart for more than half an hour.\"\nThe selection is huge, from porksiu maiand shrimp dumplings to specials that rotate with the seasons. In the evenings, Park Asia shifts into banquet-style dining, but the dim sum crowd is always out in full force – even on a Monday morning.\nWebsite:park-asia.restaurants-world.com/\nAddress: 6521 8th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11220\nPhone: +1 718-833-1688\nInstagram:@parkasiarestaurant/\nFor the best egg tarts in the city, Eng makes a beeline toXin Fa Bakery. But he doesn't just buy one. \"You get a dozen,\" he says. \"They're always hot and always fresh.\"\nThese are the classic Hong Kong-styledan tat– small, flaky tarts filled with silky egg custard. For Eng, the perfect one has a wobble. \"When you bite into it, it should be jiggly and almost fall out of the crust,\" he explains. \"You don't want it to be fully set. And you definitely don't want to see your teeth marks in it.\"\nWebsite:xinfabakery.shop/\nAddress: 5617 8th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11220\nPhone: +1 718-871-2889\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "Paul Feig's top cocktail bars around the world",
    "content": "He's always viewed cocktails as the key to the glamorous adult world – in real life and his famously daring films. Here are the director's favourite cocktail spots, from Capri to Burbank.\nPaul Feig – the perennially well-dressed director of Bridesmaids (2011) and A Simple Favor (2018) – has become almost as well-known for his love of cocktails as he is for his films.\n\"Try to find one of my movies where somebody's not drinking a martini,\" he jokes.\nThe BBC caught up with Feig as he prepared for the launch of Another Simple Favor, premiering 1 May on Amazon Prime Video. The film sees the return of Blake Lively's murderous, martini-swilling Emily and Anna Kendrick's prim Stephanie for more sensual backstabbing – this time against the opulent backdrop of Capri'sGrand Hotel Quisisana.\nNot so incidentally, the Grand Hotel Quisisana is also home to one of Feig's favourite cocktail bars.\nBut for Feig, beautiful cocktails are more than a silent film character; they are the \"greatest perks\" of the adult world.\n\"I didn't like the power dynamics of being a kid,\" explains Feig. \"I've always been obsessed with the culture of cocktails; the look of cocktails, the glassware, the mixology. It is all, to me, so beautiful.\"\nFeig believes that cocktails should always be a special moment, even if partaking at home. \"You should be wearing the right thing and have the right glass,\" he says. \"So much stuff in our culture now is for kids or trying to stay young which is fine. But being an adult is awesome. It's got its hard parts. That's why you need cocktails.\"\nAnd when he's jet-setting, Feig keeps the special occasion going, seeking out the world's top cocktail bars.\n\"I do a little research,\" he says. \"I always want to find the nicest one. I have an obsession with hotel bars... but I'll do my research and ask people; find out what they recommend as far as what I'm looking for.\"\nAnd Feig is looking for something specific.\n\"It has to be very beautiful,\" he says. \"Beautiful wood and beautiful appointments; the way they display the bottles; bartenders who are absolute professionals. I look for a good aesthetic experience with knowledgeable bartenders.\"\nHaving an adult-style tipple, he notes, can also get you a front-row seat to a new city's culture. \"Having a drink definitely tends to loosen me up,\" he says. \"I think it connects you with the group of people that might lead you to other things that you are looking for; nice restaurants and cool places to shop. I love finding the cool places to shop. I love all that stuff.\"\nHere are Feig's favourite very beautiful, very grown-up cocktail bars around the world.\nFeig's favourite cocktail on-and-off screen is forever the martini – so he holds his bartenders to a high standard. \"Honestly, I'm very prejudiced about that,\" he admits. \"If they go 'gin or vodka?' I'm always, like, 'I said a martini, I didn't say a vodka martini.' It's so fluid now with people having vodka or gin martinis. But I'm a purist. I do hold that against a bartender occasionally.\"\nBut Feig never has cause to judge when he visits the historicDUKES Bar, located in London's upscale St James's neighbourhood.\n\"It's a very small bar. It looks like grandma's living room,\" he says of the cosy space outfitted with heavy club chairs; opened in 1908. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see people from Parliament walk in there. It's got that vibe. They have a dress code, which I love. And it's where Ian Fleming discovered the martini, supposedly. So, it's got a little James Bond DNA on top of it.\"\nFor Feig, what truly makes the DUKES experience is the personable and highly knowledgeable staff – led byAlessandro Palazzi, who Feig calls his \"cocktail hero\" and a \"really close friend\".\n\"What they specialise in is martinis that don't touch ice, so they're the coldest martinis you can get,\" says Feig. \"They bring out the frozen glasses, the frozen bottle of gin. They take vermouth – which is not frozen – but they put it into the glass, swirl it around just to coat the edges, and then they dump it out on the floor, so you just have the very thin coat. Then right from the frozen bottle, they pour in the gin. So it's freezing cold; there's no excuse for [a] martini that's not ice-cold.\"\nFeig notes that because the martini never touches ice, it's undiluted: \"They limit you to two, because you'll pass out if you go beyond that.\" Feig also applauds Palazzi's \"great\"vespersand \"amazing\" Manhattans. \"You can get whatever you want, but that is the temple of the martini.\"\nWebsite:www.dukeshotel.com/dukesbar.html\nAddress: 35 St James's Pl, London SW1A 1NY\nPhone: +442074914840\nInstagram:@dukeslondon\nTheGrand Hotel Quisisanais located on the island of Capri, which Feig and his wife, Laurie, have visited \"religiously\" once a year for the past 30 years. \"Capri is my favourite place in the world,\" says Feig. \"Even when we're not staying at the Quisisana, we go there for drinks because I love the bar inside.\"\nBuilt in 1845, the Grand Hotel Quisisana sits at the start of the bougainvillea-draped, luxury-boutique-lined Via Camerelle, catching the tourist overflow from Piazza Umberto I. The hotel's marble lobby leads to opulent, Vietri-tiled guestrooms. Just past the lobby is Quisi Bar, which serves all manners of apertifs, and whose splendid street-level terrace has entertained royalty, politicians and artistic luminaries from Oscar Wilde to Jackie Kennedy.\n\"The best part is sitting out front, especially on that patio,\" says Feig. \"Everything in Capri comes past there.…  and you will people watch. It's just magical. You become a real Caprese local when you're sitting up there.\"\nWhen in Capri, Feig – who built hotel rooms on the set of Another Simple Favor to resemble those at the Quisisana – veers from his usual martinis and opts for aspritz;Aperolor limoncello. And he particularly enjoys the Italian custom of the early eveningaperitivo, where bar snacks like olives, finger sandwiches and crisps are served along with the drinks.\n\"It's, like, 'oh, here – eat!',” says Feig. \"I wrote in my cocktail book, 'Should you serve food at your cocktail party?' And yes, unless you're a monster, don't serve people cocktails with no food! It's that Italian ethos.\"\nWebsite:https://www.quisisana.com/s\nAddress: Via Camerelle, 2, 80073 Capri NA\nPhone: +390818370788\nInstagram:@quisisanacapri/\nWhen not travelling the globe for work (and martinis), Feig is often in New York City where he has a residence on the Upper East Side – and firm favourite neighbourhood cocktail joints.\n\"Bemelmans[Bar] is an institution,\" he says, \"It's in theCarlyle Hotel, which is one of the most famous hotels of opulence [in] the Upper East Side in New York.\"\nBemelmans, originally opened in 1947 and beloved for its Art Deco decor, epitomises \"old\" New York for Feig. \"I love history. I love old bars,\" he says. \"The wall's been painted by [Austrian American writer Ludwig] Bemelmans. He did all the artwork for [the children’s book series] Madeline. Back in the day, he painted all the walls with his cartoons, and so that gives it this real New York history.\"\nLike Feig, visitors to the bar will find themselves transported by the childlike murals on the walls – uplit against mahogany tables and rich leather tufted booths – as they enjoy elegant cocktails and live jazz.\nBut how's their martini?\n\"They make great martinis there with aside car, which I love,\" says Feig. \"There's a whole thing going on now in martini culture of bartenders coming over when you're halfway through a martini and bringing out a new cold, frozen glass and transferring what's left of your martini, which I think is so brilliant. Why don't we do that all the time?\"\nFeig is also a fan of the Bemelmans' waitstaff. \"I've befriended many because I've been going there for so many years,\" he says. \"It always was hard to get in. But then there was a period about two years ago where a lot of young influencers discovered it and then it went nuts. But I've been coming there so long I kind of go, 'Hey. It's me.'\"\n\"It's New York to me; the best of old New York,\" he adds. \"It's one of those places where you feel like you've walked into a New Yorker cartoon, basically.\"\nWebsite:https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/the-carlyle-new-york/dining/bemelmans-bar\nAddress: 35 E 76th St, New York, NY 10021\nPhone: +12127441600\nInstagram:@rosewoodthecarlyle/\n\"Oh, I loveThe Polo Barso much,\" says Feig fondly. \"It'snewold New York.\"\nThe eponymous cocktail bar helmed by fashion designer and philanthropistRalph Laurenis on New York City's East 55th Street just off Fifth Avenue, one of Manhattan's swankiest shopping streets. \"It's got the Ralph aesthetic,\" says Feig. \"It's all wood and mirrors and paintings everywhere, and leather. And then, if you go up the stairs in the back, there's a parlour where you can sit in front of a fireplace, and there's a bunch of tables in there to have cocktails.\"\nAt The Polo Bar, the bar staff prepares a stirred martini.\n\"Unless you ask them to shake it,\" notes Feig. \"I'm a personal fan of stirred martinis, because so many bartenders pride themselves on shaking a martini to death, which is the worst way to do a martini, as far as I'm concerned, because it just clouds it up with ice chips. The glassware is all Ralph Lauren glassware, so if you order an old fashioned or whiskey, it comes in a beautiful old fashioned Ralph Lauren glass with the polo horses on the front. Even the stirrers are little polo mallets. The attention to detail is so spot on, and the way that the bottles are displayed; they're uplit from beneath, so they glow.\"\nAnd after enjoying perfectly stirred martinis, guests can retire downstairs to The Polo Bar Restaurant. \"The food is fantastic,\" says Feig. \"It's all very American food. They make an amazing hamburger, but it's served so beautifully. But the cocktail bar really is the linchpin of the whole thing. It's all very mature and very aesthetically fantastic.\"\nWebsite:www.ralphlauren.com/global-polo-bar\nAddress: 1 E 55th St, New York, NY 10022\nPhone: +12122078562\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/poloralphlauren/\nBurbank, California, is Feig's other hometown in the United States – and it's also home toSmoke House, a restaurant and bar for which Feig's love has been well-documented.\n\"Smoke House is quintessential Americana,\" says Feig. \"I have a love of dark wood and red leather, which is what bars used to be in America for a long time. In Europe where you drink, there's windows and there's light. In America, you drink in the dark. I think it's our American puritanism.\"\nFor Feig, the Smoke House's moody interiors evoke the glamorous heyday of the Rat Pack: \"Frank Sinatra and Vegas… everybody's cool, everybody's in tuxedos and suits and gowns. The Smoke House is a time capsule of what that was.\"\nBut Feig notes that for all the bar's celebrity cache – it's located across the street from Warner Brothers, Universal and Disney Studios – he loves that the crowd is surprisingly down-to-earth. \"It's got a very populist crowd in there,\" he says. \"So it's got this great vibe of being old timey, but also very welcoming and not exclusive, which is lovely.\"\nThe bar area hosts live music the second half of the week and visitors can enjoy the restaurant's famous garlic bread and hot wings. \"I'm a buffalo wing fanatic. They've got great ones there,\" says Feig. Most importantly, they serve a \"great\" martini: \"They have really good bartenders who, if you ask for a dry martini, they know how to make a dry martini.\"\n\"It's just fun,\" adds Feig. \"It's really not pretentious but brings along the old-fashioned fun of adulthood.\"\nWebsite:www.smokehouse1946.com/\nAddress: 4420 Lakeside Dr, Burbank, CA 91505\nPhone: +18188453731\nInstagram:@smokehouse1946/\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "Ireland's time-warped island of Owey is the perfect place to disconnect",
    "content": "Located off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life – and adventurous travellers are welcome.\nFriday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades.\nLocated off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (orUaighin Irish, meaning \"cave\") is approximately 15 minutes by boat fromCruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation – and modern-day pressures – further away.\nLast inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.\nI was spending a long weekend on Owey with theWild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group \"somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible\".\nShe explained: \"It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming.\" she added.\nPaul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height ofthe Troubles. \"My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,\" explained Cowan. \"The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].\"\nHaving since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.\nDespite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.\nSeeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.\nOwey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.\nSix of our 14-strong group were staying inOwey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.\nThe hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.\nOne local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. \"Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,\" he said.\nAlongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. \"But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,\" he added.\nGallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare – and noisy – bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.\nThe hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.\nThe car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the \"village centre\" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.\nFragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.\nBy contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren – too rough to live on – with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.\nA highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves withSelkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.\nTo enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.\nPlunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed – engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.\nMore like this:\n•The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town\n•The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'\n•Ireland's heartbreaking walk of forced emigration\n\nOur last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals – who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend – joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.\nSitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition ofthe Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, \"We're winning aren't we?\". Even though I'd only met her a couple of days before, I knew exactly what she meant: the fresh air, the island's stories relayed through song, the stars so visible in the night sky… the peacefulness of Owey.

    "title": "The Pacific islands that don't want to be Hawaii",
    "content": "The Cook Islands is proving that sustainable tourism isn't just possible – it's essential. Here's how this South Pacific nation is preserving their paradise for generations for come.\nLanding on Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands chain felt like stepping back in time. Gazing out of the taxi from Rarotonga airport to our resort, we were immediately struck by the absence of high-rise hotels, fast-food restaurants and corporate chains. There were no traffic lights, only coconut palms lining the road, the scent of salt and frangipani drifting through the air and the jungle meeting the ocean in a seamless panorama. It felt like Hawaii in the 1960s: uncrowded, laid-back and refreshingly authentic.\nOur taxi driver pointed to a low-slung resort along the shoreline. \"No building can be higher than a coconut tree,\" she said. This isn't just a local tradition but a law set in 1965 by the Cook Islands' first premier, Albert Henry, to prevent overdevelopment. She explained that only Cook Islanders can own land, ensuring that large corporations don't dominate the landscape. We looked out onto hotels blending naturally into their surroundings and white-sand beaches ringed with long green parks, all free from litter and crowds.\nWe soon learned that this preservation of paradise is deeply intentional. Cook Islanders have made a conscious effort to ensure that Rarotonga never follows the path of overdevelopment seen in places like Honolulu. Instead, locals have committed to conservation, low-impact tourism and sustainable practices that benefit both locals and visitors. \"People come here because it is a paradise uncluttered by overdevelopment,\" explained Jeremy Goodwin, regenerative tourism manager for the Cook Islands Tourism Corporation (CITC). \"Our sacred duty as custodians of the land is to look after our paradise.\"\nThe Cook Islands, an archipelago of 15 islands between New Zealand and Hawaii, has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1965. With a total population of 21,000, the islands are divided into two groups: the Southern Cook Islands, which includes the more accessible Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and the remote Northern Cook Islands, made up of low-lying coral atolls. Cook Islanders have their own Māori language, with different dialects across the islands. And while tourism is a key industry, the islanders have ensured that sustainability remains at the nation's core.\n\"For hundreds of years, the protection of the Cook Islands relied on the traditional Ra'ui System where access to a particular resource or area is forbidden for a given period,\" explained Karla Eggelton, CEO of CITC. \"The system aims to conserve food resources and protect ecological conditions in lagoons, reefs and other marine resources.\"\nThis philosophy persists today – and extends beyond the sea. On the northern island of Pukapuka, for example, locals have practiced sustainable living for centuries, packing up their belongings and sailing by boat to another atoll within the lagoon for seasonal periods to prevent resource depletion. They fish and farm only what they need, maintaining a delicate balance with nature.\nOn arrival atThe Rarotongan Beach Resort and Lagoonarium, staff welcomed us with a warm \"Kia Orana\", a greeting that translates to \"may you live long\". It's a unique gesture of friendship from islanders renowned for their hospitality and warmth. The resort overlooks the Aroa Lagoonarium, a snorkelling haven and a sanctuary for butterflyfish, parrotfish and angelfish. Part natural lagoon and part enclosed habitat, it is designed to support marine conservation, serving both as a coral nursery and a protected area for marine life to flourish.\nAs the days passed, we saw how sustainability is woven into everyday life across the islands. At theMuri Night Market, a popular outdoor dinner option, we watched vendors prepare island dishes likeika mata(raw fish marinated in lime and coconut milk) andrukau rukau(taro leaves in coconut cream), all using local ingredients. We were struck by the market's Rent-a-Plate project, where visitors can borrow reusable plates and cutlery instead of using disposable plastic. Cook Islanders also promote clean water initiatives. We purchased reusable bottles from the visitor's centre and refilled them at free UV-treated water stations around the island, a project led by the Te Ipukarea Society to minimise plastic waste.\nBeyond sustainable dining, Cook Islanders have taken marine conservation to a global scale. In 2017, the country established theMarae Moana Marine Park, making the 15 islands the world's largest multi-use marine protected area, covering 1.9 million square kilometres. The legislation also bans large-scale commercial fishing and seabed mining within 50 nautical miles of each island.\n\"Marae Moana is the idea of shared space, a new concept of creating a sanctuary and the conservation effort that allows for shared, sustainable activity,\" said Eggelton.\nAlso offering opportunities for sustainable tourism is Aitutaki, a bucolic island neighbouring Rarotonga that's known for its snow-white sand beaches, volcanic rock, coconut palms and crystal-clear lagoons. Here thePacific Resort Aitutakihas launched a coral restoration project where guests can take part by affixing coral fragments to underwater mesh tables, helping regenerate the reef.\n\"The project is an example of Mana Tiaki or island conservation,\" explains Goodwin. \"Mana Tiaki means guardianship with a sacred purpose.\" He explained that culturally, for most Polynesians, the ocean is sacrosanct. \"The beaches bring tourists to this holiday destination, but they also connect Cook Islanders to the ocean.\"\nAs the days passed, we explored the endless powdery white-sand beaches that ring Rarotonga, from Aroa Beach where fiery, colourful sunsets painted the sky with hues of vivid orange and crimson to serene and scenic Titikaveka Beach. They were all pristine and uncrowded, lined by palm trees, parkways and picnic tables. Most were unobstructed, with no commercial buildings to obstruct the view.\nMore like this:\n•New Zealand's 'vanished world' of ancient megafauna\n•The 333 islands opening to the world\n•Saving the night sky: New Zealand's craziest experiment yet?\nAt Muri Beach, we opted for a sea turtle snorkelling tour. Our guide, Eric, explained the importance of turtles to the Cook Islands economically, environmentally and culturally. Daily tour operators earn an income by taking paying passengers to see these graceful, curious creatures. Plus, sea turtles are a key indicator of coastal ecosystem health, so monitoring and preservation are vital. Eric told us about a rescuer who found a turtle caught in a fishing net. Once freed, theTe Ara O Te Onu(Cook Island Sea Turtle Society) rehabilitated the turtle, as they have done dozens of times in the past. In addition to the society's efforts, visitors are encouraged to help track turtle movement through theCitizen Science Projectby taking photos and sending them into the programme.\nBy the time our trip had come to an end, we better understood how Cook Islanders have created a blueprint for preserving paradise by blending ancient conservation methods with modern environmental initiatives. \"It's about leaving both the people and the place better off than you found it,\" said Eggelton.\nGoodwin echoed the sentiment: This is our little paradise; if we all look after it, she will look after us.\" "

    "title": "The New York region that changed history 250 years ago",
    "content": "A surprise dead-of-night attack helped lead to US independence from the British. Now, a series of events are commemorating the region's pivotal role in shaping the nascent nation.\nIn the violet-grey twilight before dawn in May 1775, a skeleton crew of soldiers were asleep insideFort Ticonderoga, a British-held garrison on the banks of Lake Champlain in New York's Adirondack region, when a series of shouts rang out. Rushing to their posts, the men were stunned by the sight of six dozen American soldiers streaming over the fort's walls, flintlock rifles in hand, demanding surrender.\nWith the British outnumbered and taken off guard, American victory was swift and bloodless. The fort's commander, sergeants, gunners and artillerymen were imprisoned and the invading forces captured 100 cannons and valuable weapons for the Continental Army. The surprise attack was a pivotal moment in the lead-up to theAmerican War of Independenceand marked the Continental forces' first offensive victory of the war that led to the United States' founding in 1776.\nThis year, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the conflict that shaped the nation, Fort Ticonderoga is hosting a series ofnew museum exhibitsalongside its regular lineup ofhistorical reenactments,guided toursandboat cruises– all of which provides travellers with a great jumping-off point to explore a region replete in Revolutionary War history.\nLake Champlain is a vast expanse that extends for roughly 435 square miles, straddling the borders of western Vermont and eastern New York and spilling into the Richelieu and St Lawrence rivers, which stretch north to Montreal and Quebec City in Canada. As Fort Ticonderoga curator Matthew Keagle told me, this made the waterway and its most prominent garrisons – Fort Ticonderoga andCrown Point, located 10 miles south – key locations for the movement of British troops, supplies and intelligence during the colonial period (roughly 1600 through 1776).\nEmboldened by the Massachusetts militiamen who defended the towns ofLexington and Concordagainst British forces and initiated the war a month earlier in April 1775, two of the US's more colourful Revolutionary War figures turned north-west towards Lake Champlain.Ethan Allen, leader of the scrappy Green Mountain Boys militia, andBenedict Arnold, an ambitious, impetuous merchant whose name would later become synonymous withtreachery, reluctantly agreed to share command of a dead-of-night attack on Ticonderoga.\n\"What was effectively a defensive war against the British… now turns into something very different,\" said Keagle, smartly dressed in a royal blue coat and knee-high boots, not unlike those depicted in the famous paintingCapture of Fort Ticonderoga, which the historian stood in front of. \"It dramatically changes the scope of the conflict.\"\nThe weapons captured at the fort were hauled 300 miles by oxen and ice sledge to Boston, where Patriots used them to batter, and ultimately expel, British troops in March 1776.\nToday, some of those cannons, mortars and Howitzers are among 200,000 objects displayed at Fort Ticonderoga's museum, which houses the western hemisphere's largest collection of 18th- and early 19th-Century munitions, and the US's largest assemblage of 18th-Century military uniforms. Weaponry and cultural artefacts can also be found at the newly expanded museum atCrown Point, which was also captured by the Americans in May 1775.\nThe experiences at the two sites diverge from there. Ticonderoga, or \"Fort Ti\" as locals call it, was restored to its original glory with squat, thick walls, pointed corners and a three-storey barracks building. Each year, staff launch new programming highlighting different periods of the bastion's history. This year's includes a new exhibit showcasing the US's nascent national identity, reenactments exploring everything from Arnold's surprising command to the science of defence and a demonstration showing how soldiers would have rowed fleet ships to and from Fort Ticonderoga.\nMore like this:\n•The quiet Massachusetts towns that sparked a revolution\n•The birthplace of the US vacation\n•The manmade waterway that transformed the US\n\"We constantly have to reevaluate how we understand the past,\" said Keagle, of the fort's frequently changing educational events. \"We want to bring visitors into the discussion, whether that's through our more specialised programmes like seminars and lectures, or by walking our trails and visiting our garden to see how people lived in this period of history.\"\nBy contrast, Crown Point is an elegiac ruin, the remnants of its 18th-Century military architecture reaching skyward from the fields. A series ofwell-marked trailsloop around the historical site and ring the shoreline, including one that connects to theNorth Country Scenic Trail,which crosses eight northern US states. Because the site lies along theAtlantic Flyway, depending on the time of year, you might hear the effervescent chatter of bobolinks (which arrive in late April) , see raptors winging overhead and waterfowl gliding across the lake. Since 1976, Crown Point's bird-banding station has recorded more than 126,000 birds across 110 species.\nThe Crown Point site is also a photographer favourite, both for its bird sightings and frozen-in-time features like a pair of abandoned limestone barracks and historical graffiti carved into the stones. \"We're preserving the ruins of structures and the archaeological record beneath the surface,\" explained site manager Sam Huntington.\nAround the region, a number of hikes offer panoramic views of boththe inimitable Adirondack landscapeand its Revolutionary landmarks.\nAtCoot Hill Trail, a hike known mainly to locals located about 10 miles away from Crown Point in the town of Moriah, New York, I met Arin Burdo, executive director ofChamplain Area Trails (CAT). Our boots crunched through a late crust of snow along the moderately challenging 1.1-mile path to the 1,100-ft summit of Bulwagga Mountain.\n\"The46 High Peaks[the highest peaks in the region] get all the attention in the Adirondacks,\" Burdo told me. \"Many of these lower-elevation hikes have big payoffs, and features like historic cemeteries or great birding, without the crowds.\"\nAs the trees parted around the summit, a blanket of farms and meadows spread out below. Peregrine falcons rode air currents arcing over the cliffs, set against the distant backdrop of the Green Mountains of Vermont. To the north, the ghostly barracks of Crown Point stood out along Lake Champlain's shore.\nThe region holds plenty of interest beyond its Revolutionary past. Fishing andboatingare popular in this part of the 400,000-acreChamplain-Adirondack Unesco Biosphere Reserve, but outdoor guide Elizabeth Lee encourages terrestrial exploration, especially on CAT's 100 miles of trails. Here you may find bobcats and white-tail deer, and fancifully named plants such as scaly shagbark hickory and Dutchman's breeches, their flowers like tiny white pantaloons suspended upside-down on a clothesline.\n\"The CAT trails definitely give a slice of life over time,\" Lee said, pointing to features that date from the colonial through the Revolutionary period and beyond. \"Some have remnants of quarries, mining, farming, forestry, which takes you through the early 1900s. And there's a lot of really fun architecture [that shows] the changes in American society in those towns.\"\nCase in point:Defiance Hall by War Cannon Spirits, a distillery opened in 2022. In its cavernous, circa-1820 sawmill building, five miles from the Crown Point Historic Site, a stone alcove behind the long wooden bar was lined with whiskey, rye and vodka. I sipped a Cannonball Old Fashioned, made with whiskey, bitters, maple syrup and ginger, and wondered who used the centuries-old forest behind me to slip between strategic locations.\nOn any given day in the hamlet ofElizabethtown, New York, originally settled by Revolutionary War veterans, you'll find a few dozen of the town's 1,000 residents, plus visitors like me, gathered at theDeer's Head Inn. Opened 1808 and used as a hospital during theWar of 1812, it's now a hotel and restaurant featuring local, sustainably produced foods that nod to the cuisine of the Revolutionary past: potted lamb served with toast and curry sauce, dry-cured meats, pickled vegetables and a pear and apple crumble atop a rustic pie crust.\nNight had fallen by the time I stopped in the town ofSchroon, New York, founded just after the Revolution on a 141-sq-mile lake of the same name. Moonlight glimmered on the glassy water, diffusing pinpricks of yellow light from the hilltop cabins of theLodge at Schroon Lake, which opened in 2023 on the grounds of a former religious compound. Like many places within the Adirondacks, the reminders of the US's founding here are both visible and elusive – preserved in ruins, reimagined in modern-day interpretations and reconstructions, and alive in our collective memory.

The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink'sLisa Manobal,Patravadi Mejudhon,Tayme Thapthimthongand actor, model and businessmanDom Hetrakuljoin the star-studded cast.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui.\nHome to theFour Seasons Resort Koh Samuiwhere much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed,Koh Samuiis perhaps the ultimate White Lotusset-jettingdestination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night – daytime, office hours – we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likesSummer by Coco Tam,The ShackandGusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt,Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish andyum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui – and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns – you name it – Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in thetrailer.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot isKo Pha Nganisland, about 38km from Koh Samui – eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for theFull Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds – the parties attract thousands of attendants – Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies theMu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available onKo Wua Talap, the park's largest island,  Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommendedTa Khairestaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to theAnantara Mai Khao Phuketresort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach – Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest calledBaan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such asmee hokkien(chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional – truly local – food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titledGrand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\nAs a sports enthusiast – he practices Muay Thai – Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan ofUFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand – \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says – the actor recommends stopping by theRajadamnern Stadiumin his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring – the only one of its kind in the world.\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite:\nhttps://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram:\n@rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 onUnesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist templeWat Pho, credited as thebirthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\nAs home to theWatpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\n*This article, originally published on 26 February 2025, provides a companion to fans tuning into the Season 3 finale on 6 April.\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "content": "Oracle Red Bull Racing's driver Yuki Tsunoda talks us through the must-see places in Tokyo ahead of his home race at the Japanese Grand Prix.\nWheneverYuki Tsunodareturns to fast and furious Tokyo after months of (literally) racing around the globe, it's the city's bountiful food options that help remind him he's home.\n\"When I'm back I always make a detailed plan of where I'm going to eat,\" declares the young Red Bull driver; known for being one of Formula 1's biggestfoodies. \"On every single street and every single block there are so many great restaurants. The competition for food is so high as currently Tokyo has thehighest concentration of Michelin star restaurants in the world.\nA native of Sagamihara city, around 47km south-west of Tokyo, Tsunoda – who now lives in Milan, Italy – heads straight to Tokyo whenever he's back in Japan.  \"Even when I return to Japan now, which happens around three times a year, I normally stay in Tokyo,\" he says. \"That's where I can do business, enjoy the food and experience the nightlife. It's always so fun to be back there.\"\nEach April, Tsunoda's return to Tokyo is particularly triumphant when he races in his home Grand Prix. For Tsunoda, what separates the Japanese Grand Prix from the other tracks is the scintillating and contagious atmosphere, which he insists he \"can feel in the car\". Every time Tsunoda emerges at the Suzuka Circuit, he's greeted with a tidal wave of cheers and support that only increases when he's in the car and racing around the circuit.\nThe excitement was particularly vibrant at the2024 Japanese Grand Prix, when he finished 10th to become the first Japanese drive to score points since 2012. \"As soon as I got out of the car, I could see so many people were happy,\" he says. \"With that kind of support, you just feel like a hero. You also feel extra pressure too, and responsibility. But it's a special feeling.\"\nAfter the race, Tsunoda had no shortage of ways to celebrate. As the world's most populous metropolitan area, home to more than 41 million residents as of 2024, Tokyo is constantly abuzz with energy and excitement. Visitors (and locals) get lost in its bustling markets and bask in its futuristic, neon-lit shopping and nightlife sectors, while the city's many parks, gardens and ancient temples mean there's also room for contemplation and self-reflection.\nHere are Tsunoda's top ways to enjoy Tokyo – off the grid.\nThe city now known as Tokyo began life as asmall fishing village called Edo, inhabited since ancient times. Today, its centuries of rich history are proudly on display in its captivating backdrop of modern skyscrapers set against historic temples. Each of the city's 23 wards offers unique sights – like youthful, trendy Shibuya with its iconic \"scramble\" street crossing; and Ginza, lined with elegant luxury boutiques.\nWhen Tsunoda wants to soak up Tokyo's modern-meets-ancient scenery, he heads toAsakusa, a serene neighbourhood known for its traditional charm and for being one of Tokyo's main geisha districts. \"If you want to see the traditional side in Japan, theSensō-ji templeis so nice,\" says Tsunoda. Known for its majestic Hozomon Gate, Sensō-ji is the oldest temple in Tokyo; a five-storey pagoda and Buddhist place of worship that instantly transports you to 7th-Century Japan. Visitors to Asakusa can also stroll down Nakamise-dori; one of Japan's oldest shopping streets.\nAnd for a mile-high view of the city, Tsunoda suggests visitingTokyo Skytree. The tallest freestanding tower in the world at 634m, Tokyo Skytree offers stunning, all-encompassing views of Tokyo and beyond. \"It's the highest building in Tokyo and you can see the whole city from there,\" says Tsunoda. Visitors can also enjoy the mammoth tower's 300-plus shops and restaurants. Reserving a ticket in advance is strongly recommended to avoid queues.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.senso-ji.jp/english/\nAddress: 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0032Phone: +81 3-3842-0181\nWebsite:\nhttps://tokyo-skytree.net/\nAddress: 1 Chome-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida City, Tokyo 131-0045, Japan\nPhone: +81 570-550-634\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tokyoskytree_official\nWhenever he's in Tokyo, Tsunoda always hitsOsoba no Kougain Minato City for their soba (buckwheat) noodles. Helmed by Hiroshi Kouga – who has been making soba for more than 20 years – the elegant space remains one of Tokyo's most affordable Michelin-starred soba noodle shops.\nTsunoda also insists that visitors try wagyu steak when they're in Tokyo. Translating to \"Japanese cow\", wagyu is globally regarded as premium beef for its flavour and tenderness, made rich and juicy by the distinctive marbling pattern of fat. Tsunoda insists, \"Wagyu just tastes different when it's from a cow fed in Japan.\"\nTsunoda's favourite place to enjoy wagyu steak isUkai-Teiin the upscale Ginza district, lauded for its opulent mixture of Art Noveau and Japanese design. Watching its chefs prepare dishes on a teppan grill adds to the entertainment factor.\nWebsite:\nhttps://osobanokouga.com/\nAddress: 2-14-5 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106-0031\nPhone Number: +81 3-3797-6860\nSeafood is a staple in Japanese cuisine, taking the starring role in dishes from traditional breakfasts of grilled fish and rice to delicious, rainbow-coloured sushi.\nFor the best fish in town, Tsunoda heads toTsukiji Outer Market, locally known as Japan's \"Food Town\". Located next to the historicTsukiji Marketwhere the city's famous tuna auctions were held for decades, the lively market is crammed with stalls selling the freshest seafood. Some of the city's most famous restaurants come here to get their fish, but the market is also packed to the brim with hole-in-the-wall spots where you can snack on some of Japan's most famous foods, liketamagoyaki(omelette on a stick),mochi(glutinous rice cake) and wagyu beef skewers. It's also where Tsunoda says you can find some of Tokyo's best sushi.\n\"There are many sushi restaurants at Tsukiji Outer Market,\" he says. \"And since it is a fish market, the fish is very fresh, especially in the morning when you can enjoy it right there… It's just really great to watch people, walk around the fish market and soak up the atmosphere.\"\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/\nAddress: 104-0045 Tokyo, Chuo City, Tsukiji\nPhone number: +81 3-3541-9444\nInstagram:\n@tsukijicity\n\nWith scores of luxury and indie boutiques, Tokyo is a shopper's paradise – and there are a variety of areas that cater to Tsunoda's eclectic tastes. \"I go toHarajukuwhen I want more street-style fashion that younger people wear. There's a lot there,\" he says. Located just east of Shibuya, Harajuku – known as Japan's top fashion district – is full of colourful street art, while its mass of clothing and cosplay stores, hip bars and alluring dessert shops means it's constantly buzzing with youthful vigour.\nTsunoda's first port of call in Harajuku isGR8, which is home to many of the city's up and coming designers, selling popular clothes and footwear from the US and Europe. Its neon interior and wooden entrance makes it one of the most distinct shops in the city, too. But if Tsunoda is after vintage fashion, he heads to theShimokitazawaneighbourhood, regarded as one of Tokyo's most bohemian areas, full of music venues, cafes and clothing stores. \"That's where you'll find more casual stuff,\" he says. When in Shimokitazawa, Tsunoda shops atBABEstore, a used and vintage clothing shop where you can easily spend hours looking for lost gems amidst its mass of items.\nFor luxury clothes shopping, Tsunoda suggests the very fashionableOmotesandodistrict, sometimes referred to as the Champs-Elysees of the city. \"That's where you get the brand stuff,\" he says. \"The items that are higher in price and where the most famous brands are.\"\nTsunoda likes jumping from store to store in the Tadao Ando-designedOmotesando Hillsshopping complex. Home to high-end designer boutiques and imports from across the world, there's also the occasional vintage store and fine dining option, too.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.gr8.jp\nAddress: 4 Chome-12-10 Jingumae, Shibuya, Tokyo 150-0001\nPhone: +81 3-3408-6908\nInstagram:\n@________gr8\nThe one drinking establishment Tsunoda always tries to frequent when he's in town is Bar Centifolia, located in the laid-back Azabu Juban neighbourhood; home to embassies as well as a smattering of bars and restaurants.\nThe tiny bar has an exclusive, intimate feel with just 12 seats, and its theatrical bartenders have earned the spot a reputation for doubling as a performance space — tipplers will witness staff ferociously throwing bottles into the air, using liquid nitrogen and blue fire to create a specific taste and even chopping ice with a katana.\n\"Its bartender Yuzo Komai recently went viral because of the drinks that he makes,\" says Tsunoda. \"A lot of famous people have started going there. A lot of tourists, too. But it's such a nice bar.\" Komai's attention to detail when making cocktails, mixing each drink with surgical precision, recently saw him land theSuntory Cocktail Award Champion, one of the most coveted bartender prizes in the city.\nAddress: 6F, 1-6-5 Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku\nPhone Number: +81 3-3478-6228\nInstagram:\n@bar_centifolia\n\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food",
    "content": "Chef Ruben Bondì knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church,in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving – and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bondì, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, thetradizione giudaico-romanesca(Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset ofRoman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bondì, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes – expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy – fromcarciofi alla giudia(fried artichokes) tostracotto(braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bondì says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing – typical [Jewish] dishes likeconcia di zucchine[marinated fried courgettes] andabbacchio[roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history – from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 – Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bondì says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so]the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto – sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace – is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bondì's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near theTempio Maggiore synagogueandPorticus Octaviae– the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol –Ba'Ghettois just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bondì says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples iscarciofi alla giudia– a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes likespaghetti alla carbonaraand bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bondì says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches inVenice,FlorenceandMilan. Its main restaurant – a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures – does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearbyBa'Ghetto Milky.\nWebsite:https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram:@baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institutionRenato al Ghetto– where Bondì worked as a waiter in his younger days – realised it could replicate its success with street food, its hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosetteare a type of Roman bap,\" Bondì says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beefstracottoor Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chickenalla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under €12 (£10).\n\"It's very good,\" Bondì says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S. Maria del Pianto, 63, 00186\nPhone: +39 338 859 3395\nInstagram:@rosetteria_renato_al_ghetto\n\"Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,\" Ruben says. \"And for meat lovers, I recommendBellaCarne.\"\nLocated a mere block from the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, the restaurant's name itself is particularly promising – translating literally to \"Beautiful Meat\" – and its dishes definitely live up to expectations.\n\"I can especially vouch for their grilled meats,\" Bondì says, which includescottaditolamb and veal chops.\n\n\nBut while meat in all its forms – roast, fried, stewed and braised – is the undeniable star, it isn't the only thing worth ordering.\n\"They have an excellent vegan crostata [tart] for dessert,\" Bondì says, made with almond paste and sour cherries.\nRoman Jewish food may be humble by nature, but BellaCarne offers a decidedly refined dining experience, set in a chic, wood-panelled interior. As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.bellacarne.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 51, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 683 3104\nInstagram:\n@bellacarne/\nThe dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expresslycasereccio –homestyle, homemade.\nCasalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.\n\"It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,\" Bondì says.\nThe restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successfulDolce Kosherbakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.\nAmong its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia. Bondì emphatically recommends Casalino's roasts, but notes that the Zarfati family tightly guards the recipe.\n\"It's a secret,\" he says.\nWebsite:https://casalinoosteriakosher.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 1e, 00186\nPhone number: +39 06 7978 1514\nInstagram:@casalino.osteriakosher/\nWhile most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together),Il Giardino Romanohas adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate.\n\"It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,\" Bondì says.\nAs its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (\"The Roman Garden\") has a green thumb – its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which Bondì calls the restaurant's speciality.\nThe mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use – fromfettuccinealle vongole(pasta with clams) tocacio e pepeto even more idiosyncratic pairings.\n\"[Il Giardino Romano] has a particularly unique dessert,\" Bondì says. \"A ricotta crostata with artichoke.\"\nAnd if the menu does not succeed in evoking the bucolic delights of the Roman orchard, its setting certainly will – the restaurant has a small brick courtyard covered in trees and hanging ivy.\nWebsite:https://www.ilgiardinoromano.com\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia 18, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 6880 9661\nInstagram:@ristorante_il_giardino_romano/\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.

    "title": "From Chicago to Châteauneuf-du-Pape: What does a pope's hometown reveal?",
    "content": "From Polish pilgrimage trails to French vineyards, the places popes come from often gain new meaning. With the announcement of the first American pope, could Chicago be next?\nWhen plumes of white smoke billowed across Rome's skyline last week, signifying the election of a new pope, the entire world looked towards Vatican City. But the story of the Catholic Church's new leader began far from St Peter's Square. In a historic first, the papacy now belongs to an American.\nPope Leo XIV– born 4,800 miles away inSouth Side Chicago– took to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica on 8 May to address a frenzied crowd of more than 40,000 people.\n\"The pilgrims in the square went wild,\" said Dr Miles Pattenden, an Oxford University lecturer and expert on the Catholic Church. \"There was a lot of excitement but also gasps of surprise because a lot of people weren't expecting this name. The idea of an American pope has seemed pretty remote for most of the last half of the century. So, there was a sense of shock.\"\nPope Leo's first words to onlookers were not in English, however. He chose instead to speak in a mix of Italian and Spanish – the latter nodding to his 20+ year career in Peru – suggesting his identity spans more than one nation.\nIt begs the question: how does a pope's hometown shape his leadership – and how are those hometowns changed in return?\n\"There can't not be [a connection between pope and place],\" said Nick Spencer, a senior fellow atTheos Think Tank. \"However Catholic-with-a-small-'c' the church is, popes are from certain places and formed by certain experiences.\"\nThat was most obviously the case with Wadowice-born Pope John Paul II, says Spencer. \"It’s inconceivable to think of his papacy without recognising his Polish upbringing and his life under two different totalitarian dictatorships in Poland.\"\nA small town south of Krakow, Wadowice was once a quiet, multicultural Galician backwater. But since the elevation of its most famous son – the first non-Italian pope in 455 years, who served from 1978-2005 – it has transformed into a hub of Catholic pilgrimage.\n\"In the late '70s, Poland was already a pretty Catholic place, but the fact they had a Polish pope absolutely ignited it,\" Spencer said, explaining the impact of the papacy on Pope John II's hometown.\nToday, visitors flock to the modest family home where he was born (which has been turned into amuseum), as well as the parish church where he served as an altar boy and the square where he once played as a child.\nBetween 1996 and 2019, the number of international tourists to the museum more than doubled,according to Studies of the Industrial Geography Commission of the Polish Geographical Society, with a notable peak in 2005, the year of John Paul II's death. And in 2018, the museum celebrated its millionth visitor.\nThis speaks to the pull of a place, says Pattenden. \"Pilgrimage is significant and important for Catholics. Partly because they believe in the enchantment of physical objects, including, for instance, the bodies and the remains of saints, and the items that the saints have touched. That's why you would go back to the birthplace of a saint because you can get grace from your proximity to those things.\"\nYet not all papal hometowns are drawn into the fold. Despite serving as Archbishop of Buenos Aires for more than a decade, Pope Francis, who died this April, travelled across numerous continents, visiting 68 countries during his 12-year papacy – but never returned to Argentina.\nWhether a gesture of neutrality amid the country's fraught politics or a quiet declaration of global focus, his absence was noteworthy. In contrast to the pilgrimage energy that surrounds places like Wadowice, Francis's hometown remains, for now, a site of origin rather than worship.\nStill, his Argentine roots shaped the way he was perceived. Francis became known as the \"people's pope\", something that came from his simple lifestyle, his work in the slums of Buenos Aires and his ease with ordinary people. His background helped reinforce a public image of humility, accessibility and concern for the working class.\nJohn Paul II's Polish birthplace also had a big impact on his world view. He grew up and ministered under two oppressive regimes: first Nazi occupation, then Soviet-backed Communist rule. His papacy was defined by a commitment to human rights, religious freedom and moral resistance and he became a powerful voice against totalitarianism. During a landmark visit to Poland in 1979, his call to \"be not afraid\" resonated deeply with his countrymen, helping to inspire the Solidarity movement that would ultimately contribute to the collapse of Communist rule.\nWhile Wadowice turned piety into pilgrimage, other papal places bear more unusual legacies. In Châteauneuf-du-Pape, a village nestled in the vineyards of southern France, traces of the medieval papacy live on in the local wine.\nIn the early 14th Century, the papacy temporarily relocated from Rome to Avignon in southern France, marking a significant shift in the Church's history. From 1309 to 1377, seven successive French popes resided in the city, escaping political instability in Rome and drawn by the influence of the French crown.\nOften referred to as the \"Avignon Papacy\", this period saw the papal court flourish in grandeur, with its legacy still visible in itsPalais des Papes, a Gothic fortress that once housed the spiritual heart of Catholicism. However, it also sparked controversy, with critics accusing it of corruption and excessive French sway.\nOne pope, John XXII (from Cahors in southern France), commissioned a new summer residence in a nearby village – today known as Châteauneuf-du-Pape, or \"The Pope's New Castle\". His castle served as a fortified retreat and vineyard estate, taking advantage of the region's elevated position and favourable grape-growing conditions. The wine produced herestill bears the papal crestof crossed keys of St Peter and a tiara, and tourists can join tours that blend this medieval papal history with wine tastings trips to centuries-old vineyards.\nWith the recent ascent of Leo XIV, attention has turned to his Chicago roots. In true US fashion, even his sporting allegiances made headlines, sparking debate over whether he supported the Cubs or the White Sox (it's the White Sox, his brother confirmed). But experts say his path may diverge from traditional expectations.\nMore like this:\n•The country that’s famous for tolerance\n•The great conclave secret: What do would-be popes eat?\n•Testaccio: The foodie neighbourhood where Romans go to eat\n\"He is American but he [was] based in Latin America for most of [his life],\" said Pattenden. \"And he quite notably didn’t speak English when he did his initial greeting. That's all a sign to me that he's distancing himself from his Americanness.\"\nSpencer added: \"In addition to being an American pope, Leo's a Peruvian pope in a very profound way so that internationalism, one would imagine, is quite deep in the bone with him and it will be interesting to see if that has an effect.\"\nWhether Chicago will embrace this moment remains to be seen. Its urban parishes and immigrant congregations may well lean into a newfound spiritual spotlight. Pilgrims may one day walk the streets of South Side as they now do in Wadowice. Or perhaps, like Francis's Buenos Aires, it will remain a quiet point of origin that's respected but not venerated.\nWhat is clear is that the connection between papacy and place can linger long after the white smoke clears. It becomes a lens through which a pope's legacy is interpreted and reimagined. From wine labels in southern France to school trips in Poland, these places are transformed by proximity to power, by the long shadow of the papal office and by the faithful who come looking for something more than just a birthplace.

    "title": "8 ways to travel more sustainably in 2025",
    "content": "You're ready to book your next holiday, and you're aware of the importance of minimising your travel footprint. But where do you begin?\nIf you're stumped, you're not alone. A new Booking.comreportfound sustainability is important to 84% of global travellers. But while the desire to travel greener is strong, the path to eco-tourism is unclear for many. A Trip.comstudyfound that nearly half of travellers are confused about what sustainable travel actually means, while a 2025 World Travel & Tourism Councilreportrevealed that cost is a major barrier.\nWith global tourism bouncing back and environmental pressures intensifying, 2025 is a crucial year to rethink how we travel. Here are some simple, practical ways to make more impactful travel choices this year – without sacrificing joy or comfort on the road.\nAs you plan your holidays for 2025 and beyond, experts recommend asking yourself whether you want to be a passive tourist or a visitor who makes a positive impact on the destination. A regenerative-focused trip could involve hands-on conservation at anEcuadorian ecolodgeor choosing an Australianhiking experiencehelping to revive Aboriginal culture. Fiji's new Loloma Hour encourages travellers to dedicate at least one hour of their stay to a positive environmental, cultural or social impact activity, while Hawaii'sMālama experiencesencourage visitors to give back to the environment and local communities through habitat restoration, beach cleanups and more.\n\"We must do better than just sustain travel,\" said David Leventhal, eco-hotel owner and co-founder ofRegenerative Travel, a leading provider of educational courses aimed at transforming the travel industry into a force for positive change. \"We must reverse damage, and regenerate working at a whole systems level to integrate people and planet better.\"\nIn 2025, travellers are increasingly aware of the social and cultural impacts of tourism, with Booking.com's 2025 Travel & Sustainability Report showing for the first time that more than half of global travellers are aware of tourism's impact on local communities as well as the environment. With overtourism protests – which are already ramping up in 2025 – and unaffordable housing in popular destinations, there's a growing call to be more mindful about how, when and where we travel.\n\"That's not to say that the environmental elements of sustainable travel are less important – reducing carbon emissions and plastic are as important as ever,\" says Dr Susanne Becken, professor of sustainable tourism at Australia's Griffith University, \"but the growth of tourism is putting more and more pressure on communities to a point where some tourism hotspots don't want to engage with it anymore.\"\nSteering clear of popular destinations at peak times, being more respectful of local cultures and people, hiring local and Indigenous guides and purchasing more mindfully – from accommodation tosouvenirs– can all help to reduce pressure on communities. \"Remember that the destination you are visiting is someone's home,\" says Becken.\nLooking for immersive, community-based travel? Nepal's Community Homestay Network has launched three new \"community circuits\" for 2025, including an itinerary traversing little-visited eastern Nepal; while anew Intrepid Travel tripoffers an opportunity to engage with Indigenous elders on a journey to Colombia's \"Lost City\". Fromvisiting a Thai island that has taken sustainability into its own handsto experiencing life in agroundbreaking Swedish town, there are now countless opportunities to visit communities in responsible and regenerative ways.\nHotels and other holiday accommodations contribute alarge proportionof the CO2 emitted by the tourism sector – but better options are emerging. The world's first carbon-positive hotel,Populus, opened in the US in 2024; and IHG launched its first branded net-zero hotel in the UK in March 2025,voco Zeal Exeter Science Park.\nIn South Africa, Few & Far Luvhondo, which opened in January 2025, is among anincreasingnumber of safari lodges prioritising sustainable innovation and eco-tourism. This zero-waste, renewable energy-powered lodge is working to rewild 50,000 hectares of highly degraded land in the Soutpansberg mountains – and even has Africa's first solar-powered cable-car experience.\nBut you don't need a luxury safari lodge budget to make more sustainable accommodation choices. A network of UKhiking \"hotels\"offers free, minimal-impact stays, whileEarthshipsin the US offer unique net-zero accommodation. In Europe, social impact-driven affordable accommodation providerThe Social Hubopened a new hotel in Rome in March 2025, with another due to open in Porto this year.\nBecken recommends checking for international certification (like B Corp, EarthCheck, Green Globe and Green Key), which indicate a company is committed to energy efficiency and mindful consumption, and cares about how its people are treated. In the absence of certification, which can be financially challenging for small businesses to obtain, check the property's website for a meaningful sustainability policy encompassing environmental and social initiatives, or contact them directly to ask. The same approach can be taken with tour operators.\nMany destinations are making it easier for travellers to minimise their impact when they arrive, via initiatives likezero-waste dining,electric safaris– or evendecarbonising their entire visitor economies.\nBut while destinations are getting greener, getting there often isn't. Air travel remains one of the most carbon-intensive parts of tourism, and Becken notes that \"sustainable\" aviation fuels alone cannot solve aviation's soaring emissions.\nIn good news for rail travel enthusiasts, there are a slew of new opportunities in 2025 to take a memorable – and lower-impact – route to your destination. In Australia, theIndian Pacifichas extended its journey from Perth to Sydney to five days with new off-train experiences on each leg; whileLa Dolce Vita Orient Express, Italy's first homegrown luxury train, made its inaugural journey from Rome to the Tuscan hill town of Montalcino in April. Expected to be completed in 2025, Portugal's Evora-to-Elvas route is the first link in a high-speed network that will eventually connect Madrid to Lisbon in three hours; and a renewed version of the legendaryOrient Expresscarrying passengers between Istanbul and Paris, is due to roll in 2026, along with a new Budapest-to-Belgrade line.\nWhen you do need to fly, choose low-emissions flights with the help of booking platforms like Google Flights, which displays the average emissions for each route. Booking economy seats and prioritising direct flights also reduces emissions. Can't stand cabin wastage? Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, LATAM and SAS are just a few airlines that have taken meaningful steps to reduce single-use plastic on flights. And while carbon-offsetting your flights throughverified schemesdoes not undo the damage, many experts agree it's better than doing nothing at all.\nAnthony Bourdain famously said that \"travel is not a reward for working, it is education for living\". It's a great philosophy for sustainable travel – and one of the mostsustainableways to learn more about the place you are visiting is to book an Indigenous-led tour.\nRecord demand for First Nations experiences in Australia has coincided with the launch of new tours for 2025, including aByron Bay storytelling walkthat offers a powerful way to connect with one of Australia's most popular coastal holiday destinations. Native and First Nation tourism is alsoboomingin North America, with the American Indian Alaska Native Tourism Association naming Oklahoma's Chickasaw Cultural Center, which offers guided tours and a daily stomp dance demonstration, as thebest cultural heritage experiencefor 2025.\nMeanwhile, citizen science and hands-on conservation activities also allow travellers to engage with destinations on a deeper level. New for 2025, Natural Habitat Adventures'Kenya Rhino Conservation Safariincludes behind-the-scenes talks with conservationists in three leading private conservancies; while Aurora Expeditions, the world's first major expedition cruise line to gain B Corp certification, recently addedEyesea, a platform designed to map global pollution and maritime hazards, to its robustcitizen science programme.\nCalculating the carbon footprint of your travels is a great way to track your impact (try the University of California, Berkeley'sCoolClimate Calculator). But there are many other ways in which apps can help. Find new ways to immerse in nature withAllTrails, which features more than 450,000 trails across the globe including itstop 25 trails to explore in 2025; and discover plant-based dining options around the world with Happy Cow, which named London as itsnumber onevegan-friendly city for 2025. Connecting travellers with more than 800,000 drinking water sources worldwide,Droplymakes it easy to avoid plastic water bottles.\nMore like this:\n•Visiting Antarctica or the Arctic? Here's how to minimise your impact\n•Is it time to change how we buy travel souvenirs?\n•The African elephant in the room: Is there such a thing as guilt-free safari?\nAnd while social media has often been blamed for contributing toovertourism and other issues,research showsit can also be used as a force for good to share positive sustainable travel experiences. Did you enjoy a visit to Vilnius, the European Green Capital for 2025? Share it with your followers and inspire others to go.\nDeceptive sustainability claims – known as greenwashing – have becomeincreasingly prevalentin the tourism industry as businesses try to capitalise on growing demand for eco-tourism. In 2024, major airlines includingAir France, Etihad, LufthansaandQantaswere accused of making misleading sustainability claims, and Booking.com dropped its Travel Sustainable programme afterregulatory backlash.\n\"New legislation adopted by Europe [called the Green Claims Directive] will make it much harder for companies to greenwash, and I think we will see that roll out globally,\" says Becken. Until then, it's on consumers to stay sharp. Use resources like Sustainable Travel International's guide toavoiding greenwashing in tourism– and \"don't underestimate the value of guest reviews\", says Leventhal. \"Platforms like Google offer honest insights into whether a property or tourism experience truly lives up to its promises.\"\nRecognising the privilege to travel freely, as only a small percentage of the world's population is able to do, is the first step in making travel a force for good. Privilege gives travellers the power to spend our travel money on experiences that are good for people and the planet, from choosinganimal-friendly experiencesto ensuring activities we participate inkeep vulnerable children safeanddon't exploit culture or communities. It can be argued that privilege doesn't only come with power, but also a responsibly to pay it forward. "

    "title": "The unstoppable rise of digital detox retreats",
    "content": "It's not just a White Lotus thing: A growing number of resorts and retreats are asking their guests to put their digital devices away during their stay.\nWhen Ophelia Wu went toEremitoin Italy she was hoping for a stress-free experience. \"I was living a hectic life in London, and I found it overwhelming,\" she said. \"I needed a break. I heard about this former monastery in Umbria, and I was curious about it.\"\nShe booked a three-night stay at the hotel, which has no wi-fi or phone signal, no tech and no TVs; just brick walls, basic bedrooms and candlelight. The buzz of bumblebees replaced the buzz of her notifications.\n\"When I left, I was reluctant to turn my phone back on,\" she said. \"I got used to the peace of being unbothered and the lack of urgency.\"\nShe's not alone: offline travel is one of thetrends of the year so far. According to the2025 Hilton Trends Report, 27% of adults planning to travel say that they intend to reduce social media use during their holidays. Echoing this interest, global luxury home-rental platformPlum Guidehas seen a 17% rise in searches for unplugged, tech-lite properties. In Mexico, the luxuryGrand Velas Resortshas launched aDigital Detox Programthat would not be out of place onThe White Lotus, complete with a \"Detox Concierge\" to whisk away all electronic devices on arrival.\nWhat's striking about this trend is that it's available to everyone, it costs nothing and it's about giving less. It seems that people have become so dissatisfied with digital life that they are willing to pay more to escape it.\nWhile it has become the norm to use tech to facilitate travel logistics – bookings, check ins and itineraries – when it starts to play a starring role in the holiday experience, it can feel like the opposite of getting away from it all. According toIt's Time To Log Off, the average person spends a day each week online, and 34% of people have checked Facebook in the last 10 minutes. Sixty-two percent of polled adults, they say, \"hate\" how much time they spend on their phones.\nMartin Dunford is the founder and CEO ofCool Places, a website that has curated hotels, B&Bs, pubs and self-catering accommodation across the UK since 2012. \"We used to have a tag to show which properties had wi-fi,\" he said. \"Now we're adding a 'no wi-fi' tag.\"\nHis site lists34 places to enjoy a digital detox stay, from a Cornish eco-yurt to a boathouse on Ullswater in the Lake District, and the list is growing. Intrigued by the interest in stays where guests can disconnect, Dunford has been working with the University of Greenwich and the University of East Anglia to analyse what happens to people when they go offline on holiday. They found a distinct pattern:\n\"Guests go stir crazy in the first 24 hours,\" he said. \"But after 48 hours they are well adjusted and start getting into other activities. At the end of a three-day stay – or longer – we find guests may be happy to have their phones back or can be a bit take it or leave it about it.\"\nYou might wonder why anyone needs to book a special holiday to get off their phones: can't they just unplug themselves? But, as that difficult first 24 hours experience shows, it's not so simple: habits are hard to break, and digital addiction is particularly tough. When university researchers investigated digital-free tourism in 2019, theydiscoveredthat many travellers experienced anxiety and frustration initially, but these emotions led to acceptance, enjoyment and liberation over time. Without having a boundary put in place by an external figure or taking away the option to use screens, those positive feelings might not have been reached at all.\nAn hour from Dublin in idyllic rural Ireland, Rosanna Irwin knows all about tech overload. She's the owner and founder ofSamsú, a series of off-grid cabins in the Irish countryside, a growing business that she set up in 2024 as a reaction to her experiences leading a chronically online life.\n\"I started my career at Facebook,\" she said, \"and I was working all hours with global teams, replying to all messages, in systems where we had 'unlimited holidays' – which really meant it was harder to justify taking a day off. Ultimately being online all the time like this really broke me.\"\nIt took a trip to the quiet island of Samsø in Denmark for Irwin to see what happens when you must switch off.\n\"I spent three days with no internet there and came home feeling cured,\" she said, \"I quit my job, moved back to Ireland and spent the next eight months working on this idea. I felt this strong gut instinct to do it – and I hadn't listened to my gut for a long time.\"\nIrwin now operates two cabins, each within a 90-minute drive of an Irish city, with three more due to open this summer. In each simple space there is no wi-fi or technology, so the only tweets guests will hear are from the birds. Board games, books and a radio are provided, and the cabins come with simple cooking facilities. In case of emergency, every cabin has a phone, but it's a special, stripped back version, preloaded with podcasts and music but very little else.\n\"We're not only getting people offline,\" Irwin said, \"we're also encouraging them to discover their creativity and mindfulness. We will be launching a cookbook this summer with one-pot recipes and foraged ingredients to give people an extra purpose as well.\"\nHector Hughes is a co-founder ofUnplugged, a group of 40 tech-detox cabins in the UK and Spain. His business is also seeing growth: they expect to have 60 cabins by the end of the year. His journey, with his co-founder Ben Elliott, mirrors Irwin's: burnout and dissatisfaction in a start-up career, leading to an epiphany while on a break from tech.\n\"I was at breaking point in 2019,\" he said, \"and I went on a retreat to a Buddhist temple in the Himalayas. I was without my phone for 10 days. I had never had a break like it before.\"\nHe returned home, quit his job and decided to create a tech-free option like a retreat, but decoupled from religion and philosophy.\n\"So much of it is really about getting offline and getting into nature,\" he said. \"Just being offline for three days can have a profound effect on you. You feel a deep sense of calm at the end – it's quite surreal.\"\nMore like this:\n•Ireland's time-warped island of Owey is the perfect place to disconnect\n•A better way to 'raw-dog' travel\n•Norway's creative, isolated Arctic hideaway\nThe Unplugged experience offers modern solar-powered Scandinavian-style cabins in rural locations such as the green fields of rural Cheshire, a dark sky reserve in Exmoor and in the forested mountains of the pre-Pyrenees in rugged Catalonia. Inside, there are blankets, board games and a lockbox for devices – so guests must stay strong and lock their devices away themselves. Unplugged's mission is to make it aspirational to have time away from your phone, and to feel good about doing it.\nHe's seen some interesting results so far: \"People come away looking 10 years younger,\" he said, \"and couples in particular are more connected. If you've been together for a decade, you've probably never had a day together without a phone. The experience offers you an intense connection you might not have experienced before.\"\nWhile Hughes and his team are on a mission to make being offline an aspirational experience, Dunford thinks it could be a regular one.\n\"The detox holiday is an inevitable backlash against our hyperconnected world,\" he said. \"But in time, it might not be that unusual. Maybe being away without wi-fi on holiday will become the norm?\" "

    "title": "'It was born to be a champion': How Dubai chocolate conquered the world",
    "content": "Invented to satiate pregnancy cravings, Dubai chocolate is a rare combination of creativity, flavours and social media success that has broken all industry records.\nIt was a cold, damp evening in Munich in December 2024, but the festive tunes and the twinkling fairy lights at the MarienplatzChristkindlmarkt(Christmas market) lifted my spirits. With a mug ofglühwein(hot mulled wine) in hand, I made my way to the candy stall to get my usual supply of German Christmas cookies. But I stopped in my tracks when I realised that the longest queue was not forlebkuchen(gingerbread biscuits baked for Christmas) or the traditional stollen fruit bread, but for a new kid on the block: Dubai chocolate.\nThat was my first encounter with the viral chocolate in a land far from its birthplace. But by then, Dubai chocolate had already become a global sensation: a rich, sticky and unapologetically extra chocolate bar that hadshattered industry records, won millions of hearts and wasspreading like wildfireacross the world.\nA decadent milk chocolate bar filled with silky pistachio cream, earthy tahini and crunchy shards of knafeh pastry, the original Dubai chocolate was launched by Dubai-basedFIX Dessert Chocolatierin 2022 when its British Egyptian founder, Sarah Hamouda, had an urge to create something unique to satisfy her pregnancy cravings for knafeh and pistachio. FIX called their creation \"Can't Get Knafeh Of It\".\nCan't Get Knafeh Of It took the world by storm when TikTok influencer Maria Vehera posted arapturous videoof herself trying the chocolate bar inside her car in December 2023. The video quickly went viral, attracting more than 125 million views and scores of fans around the world who were willing to do anything to grab a bite. The bar became a craze and was promptly christened \"Dubai chocolate\".\nIn aninterviewwith the BBC earlier this year, Yezen Alani, co-founder of FIX, described the international spotlight as \"flattering and humbling\". However, despite FIX's plans for global expansion, its Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar remains solely available in the UAE, pushing independent chocolatiers and multinational brands such asLindtandÜlkerto mimic the original and produce their own versions to meet global demand. These imitations, also known as \"Dubai chocolate\", have inundated supermarkets and neighbourhood bodegas all over the world.\nToday, Dubai chocolate can be found everywhere, from the online shelves of UAE's food delivery apps and the brimming counters of Istanbul's sweet shops to the packed aisles of London's Lidl stores and the chaotic alleyways of Mumbai's flea markets. Global demand continues to skyrocket, resulting inworldwide stockoutsand aninternational pistachio shortage. It has spawned waitlists at chocolate counters across Europe and the United States and inspired limited-edition collaborations with major brands likeShake ShackandStarbucks. Supermarkets have begunrationing Dubai chocolate,and people have beencaught smugglingthe prized bars. In short, the Dubai chocolate craze has shaken the global chocolate industry.\nThis has opened up a whole new market for artisan confectioners worldwide, including the renownedMaison Samadiin London. Maison Samadi, a UK chocolatier with roots in Lebanon dating to 1872, was the first to introduce their version of the viral Dubai chocolate bars, named \"Dubai Viral Style Chocolate\" in London. For Nabil Chehab, business development director at Maison Samadi, making Dubai Viral Style Chocolate was a natural segue in their chocolate-making journey. \"We were already working on our heritage collection when we discovered the viral Dubai chocolate. It fitted perfectly because it combined a beloved Middle Eastern dessert, the knafeh, which was a tribute to the Samadi family heritage, with chocolate, our core expertise,\" says Chehab.\nChehab tells me that the demand for their Dubai Viral Style Chocolate bars has far exceeded their expectations, likely due to the interesting concept behind it. \"It's remarkable how the FIX team came up with this innovative idea of having a'dessert in a chocolate bar'that has now become more enjoyable and satisfying than just a regular chocolate bar,\" enthuses Chehab. For centuries, food lovers have relished knafeh on its own. Now, Dubai chocolate allows them to sample this well-known dessert inside a chocolate shell, making the experience even more intriguing and exciting.\n\"The real success of Dubai chocolate stems from its texture,\" agrees leading Turkish food writerAylin Öney Tan. \"The velvety gooeyness of the pistachio cream doesn't just feel good on your palate; it is also visually attractive. Additionally, the crunchy texture of thekadayifpastry from the knafeh makes the dessert even more irresistible.\"\n\"Chocolates with a palpable crunch, such as Swiss Toblerone and Ferrero Rocher, have always done well in the market,\" explains Öney Tan. \"Same with Dubai chocolate. Only in this case, the crunch goes an extra mile and primes the chocolate bar for social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\" As Vehera bites into the paint-splattered chocolate bar in her TikTok video, decadent pistachio cream oozes out and crunchyASMR(autonomous sensory meridian response) sounds fill the foreground, making it a clear social media winner.\nHowever, \"although Dubai chocolate's instant growth has been fuelled largely by social media, the exclusivity of the original bar has kept the interest going,\" says Monique Naval, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International. The original Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar is only available online at 14:00 and 17:00 through online food delivery appDeliverooin the UAE. FIX produces around 500 bars every day, and they sell out fast. The limited availability, both temporal and geographical, creates afear of missing out, further increasing interest and demand.\n\"Having Dubai in the name also adds to the chocolate's popularity and hype,\" says Naval. When people think of Dubai, they think of lavish hotels, glitzy malls, luxurious cars and gold-dusted desserts. Similar \"feelings of indulgence drive the success of Dubai chocolate,\" she adds.\nBeyond its viral fame, Dubai chocolate's resonance also lies in its deep Middle Eastern roots – tapping into family traditions of sharing sweets, gifting edible treats and the nostalgic flavours of knafeh and pistachios woven into daily life across the region.\nFor Chehab, the connection runs deep.\n\"When my wife's great-grandfather, Muhieddine Samadi, started Al Samadi Sweets in Beirut in 1872, knafeh was one of the first sweets he ever sold,\" he reminisces. \"I grew up in Beirut. As a kid, I remember taking the famous Lebanese shared taxi to Al Samadi Sweets daily, picking up a plate of knafeh for breakfast and eating it on my way to my father's shop. Little did I know [at that time] that I would be marrying Samadi's lovely great-granddaughter,\" he adds, with a twinkle in his eyes.\nIn an interview withArabian Businesslast year, Hamouda said, \"I wanted the FIX experience to be different. I wanted people, from that first bite, to relive moments of their past.\" And for many fans around the world, that first bite delivers exactly what Hamouda intended: an edible journey back to bustling Middle Eastern souks, where merchants sell delicious local sweets and the air is dense with the aroma of pistachios.\nMore like this:\n•The baffling purple honey found only in North Carolina\n•The world's true cradle of chocolate\n•A beauty mogul's guide to luxury self-care in Dubai\n\"Sixty-eight percent of the world's consumers want to experience cultures other than their own and that includes a willingness and desire to try new flavours and ingredients,\" explains Naval. Pistachios – a Middle Eastern staple – are riding this wave too, billed as thenext big seasonal flavour globally, and appearing in everything from lattes to liqueurs.\nAt the same time,Middle Eastern tourism is boomingand Dubai has emerged as a culinary destination in its own right, with some visitorsflying injust to taste the viral chocolate firsthand. What began as a simple chocolate bar in a Dubai dessert shop has evolved into a global sensation.\n\"I am not surprised,\" says Chehab, reflecting on the chocolate's meteoric rise. \"It is the perfect amalgamation of taste, texture, indulgence and nostalgia. It was born to be a champion.\" \n"

    "title": "The flawless biscuit that took years to master",
    "content": "Acclaimed musician Rhiannon Giddens spent years perfecting a flawless recipe for the iconic Southern food. Now, a new festival reveals the similar journeys of Black music and cuisine.\n\"Womp, womp, womp.\" That's the sound, according to Grammy Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning musicianRhiannon Giddens, of a sharp-rimmed glass cutting into just-right biscuit dough. Coming from Giddens' mouth, the timbre translates as a low note plucked from a double bass.\nGiddens is an American scholar-musician whose folk, country and blues music illuminates the African lineage of the banjo and celebrates the legacy of the Black string band. But in 2020, at the outset of pandemic lockdowns, Giddens found herself craving something seemingly less academic: biscuits. Not the crisp British variety that Americans call \"cookies\" and \"crackers\". Not crumbly, sweetened scones – those she could buy in abundance in her adopted city of Limerick, Ireland. No, what Giddens wanted were flaky, buttery biscuits with a definitive rise, the kind that are ubiquitous across the American South.\nFive years later, after tweaking her formula and method, Giddens has landed on what she believes is a near-perfect biscuit recipe. Her pandemic baking obsession even inspired her newBiscuits & Banjosmusic festival, which showcases the similarly winding journeys of Black music and food.\nDuring the pandemic, Giddens was collaborating with Italian musician Francesco Turrisi on the albumThey're Calling Me Home. \"Francesco and I were thinking about the food that we couldn't get because we couldn't go home,\" said Giddens, who grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina. \"For me, that turned into, 'How do I make biscuits?'\"\nLiving in Ireland, Giddens had to rework basic elements of biscuit composition. How would Irish butter, with its higher fat content, impact the texture and rise? Which European flour would yield a comparable crumb? That's to say nothing of technique. \"It turned into an obsession pretty quickly,\" she said.\nGiddens practiced until she arrived at a flawless variation with an adapted recipe from Southern Living magazine. First, she grates frozenKerrygold butterinto frozen, siftedWhite Lily flour(the colder the ingredients, the better). Next, she pours in thick buttermilk, and after a cursory stir, she dumps the wet mixture onto a heavily floured counter. \"I start folding, turn, fold, turn, fold, turn, pat it out. I don't bother with a rolling pin,\" said Giddens. \"I was doing four sets of folds, and then I threw in an extra one. The biscuits wentpoof.\"\nThen comes cutting the dough – the womp – before she places the biscuits cheek-to-cheek on pre-cut parchment paper. Meanwhile, there's a sheet pan heating in the oven at 475F, a critical step that yields crispy bottoms. At first, Giddens confessed, she often underbaked her dough. Now, she checks how done it is after 12 to 15 minutes by gently pressing her fingers on top and jiggling a nascent biscuit; too much movement signals a gummy centre.\nGiddens' ideal biscuit has a certain flakiness. It's sturdy enough to hold bacon without crumbling, and tender enough to enjoy with jam. During the years it took her to master biscuit making, They're Calling Me Home won a Grammy Award for best folk album. She also composed and sang inOmar, an opera that earned the Pulitzer Prize, and played banjo and viola on Beyoncé's hit single,Texas Hold 'Em. Along the way, she started to see how biscuits integrated into her life's work of tracing the complex history of music.\n\"Food and music have similar cultural markers. Like food, music moves with people, and it changes as people move. So, it made sense to connect them,\" said Giddens. \"Biscuits and banjos happen to be two of my obsessions.\"\nBiscuits, like the banjo, have a complex lineage. Their roots lie in dry, twice-baked breads, or rusks, that the British called \"bisquites\" after the Latin phrasepanis bicoctus, or \"twice-baked bread\". But in the American South, particularly in the hands of Black cooks, they became soft, leavened symbols of class, skill and Southern identity.\nIn the bookThe Biscuit: The History of a Very British Indulgence, Lizzie Collingham writes that biscuits were an \"an indispensable tool of empire building\". Indeed, these nonperishable breads sustained soldiers and sailors for millennia, and in the early 1600s, English settlers in Jamestown, Virginia, survived on a supply of biscuits brought from the motherland.\nA distinctly Southern biscuit began to emerge in the 18th Century. On Royal Navy ships, tough, dry biscuits had earned the nickname \"purser's nuts\". But in finer settings on both sides of the Atlantic, bakers added sugar, citrus and spices. The Virginia Housewife, an 1824 cookbook by Mary Randolph, includes a recipe for Tavern Biscuits, whose ingredients included flour, sugar, butter, mace, nutmeg, brandy and milk. It also shared a recipe for beaten biscuits.\n\"[Beaten biscuits] were the most common biscuit in the South,\" saidMichael Twitty, a James Beard Award-winning food writer and historian. \"The lore behind them is true. A Black child, normally a little boy, would sit there with the back of an axe or a club, and on a clean log, he would literally beat this dough over 1,000 times.\"\nThe thin, crunchy beaten biscuit closely resembled what Americans consider a cracker, but this violent, repetitive thrashing – only possible with enslaved labour – produced a slight rise and delicate crumb onto which diners would drape slices of country ham. White flour was still a luxury in the antebellum South, and beaten biscuits were an edible stamp of wealth.\n\"Biscuits have been a demarcation line in terms of class and race,\" said Toni Tipton-Martin, a food journalist and historian whose work includes the bookThe Jemima Code: Two Centuries of African American Cookbooks. \"African Americans have traditionally been known for making cornmeal and more coarse grain breads. Wheat flour was not available in early America, and it was an expression of affluence to be able to make biscuits.\"\nHowever, it was chemical leavening agents that created the soft, layered Southern biscuit as we know it today. At first, bakers used saleratus (potassium bicarbonate) and soda (sodium bicarbonate). The buttermilk in Giddens' recipe dates to these early leavening agents, which required an acid to activate. Then in 1856, Eben Norton Horsford patented baking powder, officially giving rise to the poof of the Southern biscuit.\nAs milling technology improved in the late 19th Century, Southern-grown soft winter wheat, (which was better for so-called \"quick breads\" than sturdy loaves) gained popularity. When flour prices dropped, biscuits became a marker of social mobility across racial lines, transforming a Sunday treat into an everyday staple.\nMore like this:\n•How rice shaped the American South\n•The surprising origin of fried chicken\n•Pig ear sandwich: An iconic dish of the American South\nAmerican food industrialised in the 20th Century, and so did biscuits. An unnamed Black cook for Pullman Company trains used a premade flour mix to produce biscuits on the fly; his work inspired Bisquick, the first commercial biscuit mix. In 1931, Lively Willoughby patented canned refrigerated biscuit dough. Biscuit diversity flourished, too, such ascathead biscuitsand North Carolina'shoop cheese-filled variety. Bakers embraced efficientdrop biscuitsand airyangel biscuits, which use baking powder, baking soda and yeast.\nBiscuits had transformed from a seafaring staple to a luxury good made by enslaved cooks to a food of the working class. Farmers and labourers carried biscuits slathered with jam or stacked with ham in their lunchpails. Twitty recalled a line from South Carolinean journalist Ben Roberston's memoir,Red Hills and Cotton: \"To fry chickens, to boil coffee, to boil rice and to make good biscuits were the four requirements we demanded of cooks.\"\nThe year of Giddens' birth, biscuits broke into America's fast-food pantheon. In 1977, Bojangles, a fried chicken and biscuits counter, first opened in Charlotte, North Carolina; there are now 800 Bojangles across 17 states. The same year, a single location of Hardee's added ham and sausage biscuits to its breakfast menu. Across Hardee's franchises, workers bake more than 100 million biscuits annually. In the 1980s, Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds took biscuits nationwide.\nButtered, dotted with blueberries, smothered in sausage gravy, split and sandwiched, biscuits had become wholly American without losing their Southern accent. \"I see this food as graduated British, even if there's nothing like it in the British Isles, not even scones. You can't find them in Africa,\" said Twitty. \"So they're this combination of all those different streams and elements that make America what it is.\"\nWith Biscuits & Banjos, Giddens wanted to create a festival that would build community and inspire cross-disciplinary collaboration, and the three-day event in Durham, North Carolina (25-27 April) brought together Black musicians, activists, historians and chefs. Her Grammy-winning band,The Carolina Chocolate Drops, reunited for the first time in a decade, performing songs from acclaimed African American fiddlerJoe Thompsonand guitaristEtta Baker.New Dangerfield, a Black string band of Giddens acolytes, played a sweet and earnest New Orleans waltz, whileNiwel Tsumbuconnected the musical traditions of his native Congo to the American South.\nBy day, festival-goers ate biscuits from restaurants on a downtownDurham biscuit trailand bought tote bags that read: \"Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit\". They also gathered in an armoury, which had held a square dance the night before, for a talk with Tipton-Martin, Twitty and Dr Cynthia Greenlee on biscuit history and the contributions of Black cooks to one of the US South's most iconic baked goods.\nGiddens hopes to stage the festival again in Durham in 2026, creating a space where food and music continue to challenge narratives, uplift Black stories and contribute new ideas to storied traditions.\n\"Food and music are such a great way to talk about culture,\" says Giddens. \"They're disarming. They're innocent. They are shaped by the forces around them, whether that's political or cultural. The more we can understand that, I think, the more we can understand ourselves.\"\nRhiannon Giddens' \"They're Biscuits, Not Scones\" recipe\nAdapted from Southern Living magazine\nMakes 10-12 biscuits\nMethod\nStep 1\nMeasure a piece of parchment paper to fit your sheet pan; be sure to make it longer but exactly as wide, so you can use the overhang to lift the sheet when there are biscuits on top. Set aside.\nStep 2\nSift the flour into a bowl, then grate in the frozen butter (I use a box grater, the large holes side). Toss together briefly (but no need to work the butter into the dough). Put in the freezer.\nStep 3\nWhile the bowl is in the freezer, preheat the oven to 475F. If you have an electric oven, put the pan in the oven and heat it up without the parchment paper. If you have a gas oven, you can keep the pan out of the oven and place the parchment paper in it. This is all in pursuit of nice crispy bottoms.\nStep 4\nMake a well in the middle of the butter/flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk. Always have more on hand in case you need it – I usually have to add a bit. Stir until it starts to come together. It should be pretty sticky and a bit wet. Turn it out onto a well-floured surface and pat it into a rectangle (you can use a rolling pin if it helps).\nStep 5\nFold the dough in thirds like a letter and flatten out, then turn and do it again in the other direction. Do this whole process at least once more, for a total of 4 sets of folds. This is what takes the most experience; you’ll eventually learn how much handling is enough. Aim for handling less, not more.\nStep 6\nRoll or pat out and start cutting your biscuits; use a biscuit cutter or a glass and be careful not to twist (that is a myth that will end up actually curtailing your biscuit's rise). If the dough is in that sweet spot of not too wet but not too worked, the cutter will not stick to the dough, and if it's a glass it will make a nice little \"womp\" sound.\nStep 7\nPlace the biscuits on the parchment paper in a honeycomb pattern so that there are no spaces. This will help the biscuits rise. If you like biscuits that are crispy all around and not as tall, you can place them with space around them or only touching on the sides.\nStep 8\nMove the biscuit-laden parchment with the overhang onto the pan, this will take practice. You may brush melted butter on top of the biscuits at this point.\nStep 9\nBake at 475F for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned. You can feel they are done by shaking one with your fingertip on top; if they are too moveable, they aren't quite set.\nStep 10\nPlace them in a basket lined with a tea towel and cover; they will stay nice and moist this way. Put the leftovers straight into the fridge to be reheated in the oven when ready. "

    "title": "Koh Mak: The tiny island that's redefining travel to Thailand",
    "content": "With season three of The White Lotus drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand.\nAs season three ofThe White Lotusprepares to thrust Thailand's islands into the global spotlight, drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. Here, a speck of an island named Koh Mak has quietly positioned itself as a model for sustainable tourism, offering a rare vision of what the future of travel in Thailand could be.\nHeading towards Koh Mak's southern shores by speedboat, my first impression was disarmingly simple: golden sand curving into clear shallows while coconut palms leaned towards the sea as though caught mid-bow. There were no high-rises, no blaring beach clubs. Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads.\nI checked into theMakathanee Resortnext to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea.\nAs I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand.\nPromoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) asthe country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours ­– party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south – Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earnedinternationalrecognitionfor sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future.\nWhile many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism.\n\"It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,\" Sudhidhanakul said. \"But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor – those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.\"\nIn 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers.\n\"We never worried about overtourism,\" said Sudhidhankul, \"as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.\"\nThis ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like theKoh Mak Coral Conservation Groupoffer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated byTrash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, \"Every week we clean, we educate, we change\". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.\nMore like this:\n•Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n•Here's where Asia's best female chef goes for pad Thai in Bangkok\n•Thailand's cooling rice dish to beat the heat\nI spent the next few days earnestly practising slow-life activities: reading in a hammock, snoozing in a deck chair, swimming and taking long walks along the beach looking for shells. Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes – plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga.\nI took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined atie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort.\nOne day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of theKoh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. \"When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,\" she said. \"I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.\"\nKoh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub,Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. \"We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy.\" Sudhidhanakul told me.\nYet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm – cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness – it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand.\nIt is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead. "

    "title": "Capri has two faces – here's the one you've never seen",
    "content": "The Italian island immediately conjures up grand bougainvillea-draped villas and a whitewashed city centre, lined by luxury boutiques. But that's – literally – only half of the story.\n\"Bring water,\" they said when I announced I'd be hiking theSentiero dei Fortini(Trail of Little Forts). \"There'snothingout there.\"\nThe six-kilometre cliffside path linking the remains of three 19th-Century Bourbon military outposts was my fourth hike on this craggy Mediterranean island. Somewhere along the rocky, wild rosemary-flocked path while dodging spiky prickly pears, I realised that I'd only seen one other human in two hours. And there were indeed no water sources, aside from a rustic fountain I'd encountered a kilometre back at Fort Mèsola.\nMy Google Maps sputtered. I'd already got lost twice before noting that the ceramic path markers were low to the ground, cataloguing the area's flora and fauna – fig trees and wildflowers, wall lizards and falcons. The terrain faded from wilderness to sheer crags. Finally at the last fort, Fort Orrico, I could see straight down to the sea; a 30m death drop. The islands of Ischia and Procida loomed in the Gulf of Naples like the humps of petrified sea monsters. And I was completely alone at the island's edge; triumphant.\nThis is Capri. But perhaps not as you imagine it.\nTypically, the word Capri conjures up bougainvillea-draped villas and luxury boutique-lined streets; a yacht dock for the glitterati and the perpetual artists' muse. Paul Feig'sAnother Simple Favor, which premiered on 1 May on Prime Video, is the latest film set against the island's opulent hotel culture and majestic cliffs, and is sure to inspire a fresh slew of Capri travel dreams.\nBut in Capri, glamour is – literally – only half of the story.\nThe camel-humped Capri – one of Italy's threevolcanic Phlegrean islands– is actually home to two distinct towns. At the eastern end lies the princess Capri Town where loafer-wearing VIPs sip espresso in Piazza Umberto I; thefaraglionisea stacks winking in the distance. And at Capri's western end is her rugged little sister, the township of Anacapri; a sea cliff and prickly pear paradise where hiking boots replace stilettos and wild outdoorsy adventures trump wild nightlife.\nBut while Capri seesas many as 16,000 visitorsa day – outnumbering the 12,900 full-time residents – the majority only visit Capri Town.\n\"There's two main reasons for this,\" surmises Camilla Formisano, copyeditor atCapri.com. \"Time and imagination. Seventy to 80% of visitors arrive on organised excursions from Naples, Sorrento or cruise ships. So they visit the most famous, easily accessible places from the port, like Piazza Umberto I.\"\nFormisano also believes that social media plays a part: \"People see the faraglioni and the piazza and think, 'I saw Capri'. Social media has condensed the island into a single postcard.\"\nSocial media is merely Capri Town's latest PR rep. Before becoming a premier Italian bucket list destination, Capri was a humble fishing island. It was settled by the Ancient Greeks, later becoming the seaside retreat of the Roman emperor Tiberius, who leftgrand villasin his wake. It wasn't until centuries later, when the Romantic poets and then Hollywood filmmakers turned their artistic eye on Capri Town, that it becamea VIP haven. Today, visitors spill out from the ferry and throng the bus and funicular ticket booths to jockey for place in Piazza Umberto I, dodging motorised luggage carts and women in Instagrammable sundresses at every turn.\nMeanwhile, it's just a 15-minute bus ride to Anacapri, where respite from Capri Town's day-tripper crowds and inflated prices await.\n\"Anacapri isn't completely free of overtourism,\" admits Formisano, referencing the tourist crush at theBlue Grotto,Villa San Micheleand the chairlift toMonte Solaro. \"But head west, through the Boffe [main] quarter towards the lighthouse and theMigliera[trail], and you'll find the island's heart.\"\nAnacapri is crisscrossed by stone-walled paths that yield to sudden sea views; perfumed in springtime by blooming orange trees. The terrain is hilly; locals zip by me on scooters and dusty motorised three-wheeled buggies. One wrong turn and I find myself either wheezing up a steep incline or at the cliff's edge.\nDespite the divine aimlessness of wandering Anacapri on foot, its principal outdoor attractions are best reached with wheels. TheATC Capri Srlbuses operate regularly between Piazza Vittoria, the Blue Grotto andPunta Carena, a craggy bay dominated by the island's rust-red19th-Century lighthouse, where sunbathers splay themselves on the rocks or dive nose-first into the sea. Beach clubs are cut into the cliffs, the most beloved beingda Antonio, a shack serving panini, gelato and an excellent crouton-and-auberginepanzanellasalad. The upscaleLido del Farofeatures a pool and a full-service restaurant; I enjoy a bracing limoncello Spritz while watching the wild swimmers from above.\nBut Punta Carena is best known for its sunsets.\n\"It's the only place on Capri where the sun sets into the sea,\" says Formisano. \"Thanks to Capri's particular shape, Anacapri remains sun-kissed until sunset. Sunsets here are a special experience, casting a golden light that envelops the landscape.\"\nIt was Formisano who first directed me to the Trail of Little Forts. \"A must-see,\" she called it.\nThe medium-difficulty trail runs along Anacapri's western coast between the Blue Grotto and Punta Carena. It's possible to start the trail at either end, but most trekkers begin at the Blue Grotto.\n\"So you can walk calmly immersed in nature, have a swim in Mèsola cove and get to the lighthouse by afternoon; just in time to enjoy an aperitif and the magnificent spectacle of the sunset over the sea,\" says Formisano.\nBack in the Boffe quarter, Piazza della Pace is the origin point for two other brilliant Anacapri hikes; the Migliera trail and Mount Solaro.\n\"The Migliera is a narrow road winding through the countryside,\" says Formisano. \"You'll come to a dramatic cliff overlook. Climb the ridge to the left; you'll get a really unique view of the faraglioni.\"\nHowever, the view from Mount Solaro – Capri's highest point – is arguably the island's most famous. The 13-minute chairlift up the 589m mountain provides unforgettable views of terraced vineyards with the Amalfi Coast winking in the distance.\nVertigo? Summit Mount Solaro on foot by following Via Axel Munthe to Via Salita per il Solaro, keeping an eye out for stray mountain goats.\nFor any Anacapri hike, wear trail shoes; not your new Capri leather sandals. Before setting off, \"stop atDe Martinoin Piazza Capri for an excellent panino\", advises Formisano.\nMost people reach Anacapri by bus, but if you're fit, consider tackling the 1.7kmScala Fenicia, a 921-step flight of stone stairs chiselled into the cliffs by the Ancient Greeks; allowing countless generations of hardy Capresi to travel between Capri and Anacapri.\n\"It's not for everyone,\" admits Pep Minichino, founder of the Gulf of Naples-based blog,Campanica. Nonetheless, he encourages visitors to \"embrace the experience! All you need is a Led Zeppelin anthem [in your head] for the energy to climb the famous zig-zag staircase.\"\nThe Scala Fenicia, which can be accessed from Marina Grande, leads straight up to Villa San Michele, the residence of the early 20th-Century Swedish physician and author Axel Munthe. The sprawling mansion – built over Roman ruins, featuring grand sitting rooms and Neoclassical gardens – is Anacapri's most touristed museum. But I came to climb, and my heart rate thunders as I bypass the tourist hordes at Marina Grande to undertake the trek, surrounded by olive trees, terraced lemon groves and, finally at the top, the sea.\n\"La Scala Fenicia is also open at night, so you can go down step by step,\" says Minichino. \"Slowly. Aided in your descent by a cascade of lights and stars.\"\nBy far, Anacapri's most visited attraction is the Blue Grotto (Grotta Azzurra), famed for its magical blue phosphorescence. Chaotic overtourism has engulfed this natural phenomenon, and I am overwhelmed by the massive queue and dozens of tourist-packed boats bobbing outside the grotto. But, once inside, the azure-blue light is breathtaking, and I am comforted as the boat captain's serenade of O Sole Mio echoes through the cave.\nFormisano's hack: \"The best way to visit the Blue Grotto is to be on the entrance steps at 09:00, arriving by land from Anacapri, not by sea from Marina Grande,\" she says. \"This way you'll be first in line. You won't have to wait your turn on a rocking boat.\"\nBut to truly enjoy the seas of Anacapri, Formisano suggests doing as the Capresi do: \"Going down to the Blue Grotto, follow the signs for \"gradola\" to reach a small terrace overlooking the sea with an excellent restaurant, a place frequented almost exclusively by locals.\"\nMinichino agrees: \"The best swimming, diving and sunbathing in Anacapri.\"\n\"After a day of outdoor activities in Anacapri, the best way to relax is to immerse yourself in the town's authentic, peaceful atmosphere,\" says Formisano.\nMy B&B,Giardino dell'Arte, is no sumptuous 19th-Century Capri Town palazzo, but my tidy room is floored with blue and white ceramic tiles, and orange blossoms spill over the wooden door. The courtyard overlooks a garden and the innkeeper offers me homemaderavioli alla Caprese; round ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs.\nStrolling deeper into the Boffe quarter, I come uponLa Casa Rossa, a bright red mansion built by the American colonel John Clay MacKowen in the early 20th Century; a quirky blend of architectural styles ranging from medieval to Middle Eastern. There are generational bakeries in leaf-shaded alleys where I buy fistfuls of sour cherry pastries andpizzette.\nBut the neighbourhood stunner is theChiesa Monumentale di San Michele Arcangelo, a petite Baroque church with a show-stopping majolica floor in ochres and blues depicting the Fall of Eden. The tiles can only be viewed from strategically positioned wooden boards or from the balcony above. Wide-mouthed crocodiles, lions and hooved Biblical beasts leer up at me, Adam and Eve at the centre of the fray.\nIt's my favourite island view… until the rooftops.\nBecause Anacapri is still Capri, just off the Boffe quarter there are two opulent hotels;Jumeirah Capri Palaceand the historicHotel Caesar Augustus, a palatial structure dating to 1850 whose clifftop terrace seems to extend into the sea. I charm my way into both, and wind up on their rooftop bars as the sun sinks pink and purple into the Gulf of Naples, throwing Ischia and Procida into bas relief. Another limoncello Spritz, and I sink into a luxurious armchair, crossing my dusty ankles in their hiking boots; princess and athlete all at once. "

    "title": "The artichoke so prized that people sell fakes",
    "content": "For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands – and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.\nThe water glitters in the sunlight as Venetian farmer Guia Camerino steers her boat past thebriccole, the wooden piles that mark invisible – to non-Venetians – lanes through the lagoon. Just a few kilometres north of Venice's warren of tourist-packed streets are the islands of Sant'Erasmo and Le Vignole, known as \"the vegetable garden of Venice\" for their lush, fertile ground – and for a rare flower that grows for only 10 days a year.\nCamerino is one of just four farmers on the island of Le Vignole, and she specialises in thecarciofo violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a Venetian type of artichoke plant that produces a local delicacy known as acastraùra. The castraùre are the plant's first buds: small, tight and conical artichokes that are \"castrated\" off the plant – giving them their name – in order to allow thebotoli, larger buds (and the kind you'd probably find on your plate the rest of the year), to grow in their place.\nSpring is a busy time of year for Camerino as the violet artichokes come into bloom and must be harvested during a short window of about two weeks, with each plant only producing one castraùra a year. The tiny artichokes, half the size of a human palm, are highly prized, both for their rarity and their unique, saline taste.\n\"It's hard to describe the taste if you've never had it before,\" she explains, as we walk through her artichoke fields, the belltowers of Venice visible on the horizon. \"It's initially bitter but transforms into sweetness in the mouth. It's very versatile and easy to eat – not like a Roman artichoke that you have to peel and prepare laboriously. The castraùre are so tender that you can eat them raw.\"\nThe castraùre's rarity means that for years Venetian farmers have had to deal with counterfeit versions coming from elsewhere in Italy. The violet artichoke doesn't just grow in the Veneto – this species of plant is also grown in Tuscany, Sardinia and Sicily. But any Venetian will tell you that a true Sant'Erasmo artichoke tastes nothing like itsterrafermacounterparts. That's because the islands are positioned at the lagoon's opening to the Adriatic, which makes the soil distinctively salty – a salinity that is tempered by rainwater. There's even a festival dedicated to the artichoke (usually on the second Sunday in May) when people travel from all over the lagoon to Sant'Erasmo to eat artichoke dishes, drink artichoke-based spritzes or digestifs and buy entire pallets of the vegetable to take home before the season ends.\nIt's not easy to coax the flower out of the plant. Everything is done by hand, with no pesticides, and in Venice there's the ever-present danger of anacqua alta(seasonal flooding) that could drown the fields. An artichoke is a perennial plant that has to be cut back every summer in order to grow imperceptibly during the winter months. Now climate change is causing the season to arrive earlier and earlier.\n\"It's very worrying,\" says Camerino. \"The plant needs nine months to slowly grow. Traditionally, the castraùre were harvested on 25 April, Saint Mark's Day. But we harvested our first castraùra at the beginning of April this year. It's getting hotter earlier and earlier, and the plants won't have time to grow. Eventually, the castraùre could disappear.\"\nBecause they're so delicate, the castraùre don't get exported far out of the lagoon and are usually harvested, sold and eaten in the same day. Camerino sells directly to restaurants in Venice that \"understand the quality\" of the product. The problem, she says, is that many restaurants in Venice have stopped buying real castraùre \"because they're expensive and non-local customers can't tell the difference. So they use normal artichokes but pretend they're castraùre so they can hike up the prices.\"\nAl Covino, a Venice restaurant that focuses on local produce and traditional ingredients recognised by Italy's Slow Food presidium, makes a point of serving the castraùre when they come into season. It's a cosy space with pistachio-green roof beams, hanging plants and only 15 covers, hidden on a small street in the city's Castello neighbourhood and run by husband-and-wife team Claudio De Lauzieres and Claudia Torcellan. De Lauzieres, a Neopolitan who has been living in Venice for 12 years, rhapsodises about the local ingredients with a boyish enthusiasm: \"Neapolitan cuisine is much more well-known than Venetian cuisine, but the lagoon offers so many different environments and unique tastes. The castraùre symbolise the richness of the land here.\"\nHe prepares three castraùre dishes: a silky, gently sautéed version that doesn't just melt on the tongue but entirely disappears, leaving a subtly sweet aftertaste; tagliolini in a velvety artichoke sauce; and raw shavings of the vegetable in a salad with oil, parmesan and a hint of lemon zest. He watches my face as I take a bite of the salad and grins at my expression of surprise at the tiny bud's powerful taste. Its flavour instantly takes me back to Camerino's boat and the smell of the salty lagoon air whipping past my face.\nOn Sant'Erasmo, local farmer Carlo Finotello has been working for years to crack down on the falsely labelled castraùre that appear in markets and shops across the lagoon. He runs the farmI Sapori di Sant'Erasmowith his brother Claudio and is also the president of theConsorzio del Carciofo Violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a consortium created in 2004 to promote the local violet artichoke. Its label is a mark of quality and authenticity.\n\"Some vegetable sellers take the consorzio label and stick it on other crates of normal artichokes,\" Finotello explained. \"Or they will buy some castraùre but then mix them in with normal artichokes so they're still making a bit extra.\"\nWhen the consortium receives a tip-off about producers passing off Tuscan artichokes as the Sant'Erasmo version, Finotello contacts them directly to ask them to desist – but the consortium isn't a policeman, he says, and they have no power to issue fines, nor the time or money to take them to court. He says that it's vital to only buy castraùre from a local producer, and to always make sure that they have the consortium's label, in order to protect the centuries-old tradition of growing them.\nMore like this:\n•Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n•The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n•Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food\nI visit Finotello at his farm to see him harvest the castraùre. It's a muggy day with a hot, salty breeze, and the earth is springy after days of rain. The artichoke plants are slowly opening up in the sun. Finotello shows me how to cut a castraùra gently off the stalk with the traditional curved knife, which he holsters in the pocket of his overalls between rows. The plants used to be fertilised withscoasse(garbage in Venetian dialect), a mix of fish bones and old crab shells. \"We can't do that anymore because there's too much plastic in the food system,\" Finotello tells me, shrugging. \"We'd just be feeding the plants plastic.\"\nWhen he finishes harvesting the small field, he counts how many castraùre he picked: 105. He then dumps the basket in the back of his trailer and looks at me, grinning. \"Now you need to eat some.\"\nAt the farmhouse, his mother, Mirella Bubacco, is holding court in a kitchen busy with the detritus of the recent Italian Easter celebration: chocolate eggs and endless cups of espresso next to slices ofcolomba, a type of Italian Easter cake. Mirella is warm, businesslike – and very chatty.\n\"Don't ever eat it as an antipasto!\" she warns me, a paring knife in one hand. \"The taste lingers in your mouth, and it'll alter the taste of your first course.\" She insists that it is best eaten in the very simple Venetian style: uncooked, julienned, with a ribbon of light-tasting olive oil, a bit of salt and shavings of Grana Padano. \"The earth here on Sant'Erasmo is all the condiment you need!\" \n"

    "title": "The world's five happiest cities for 2025",
    "content": "Friends, family and a sense of community all can lead to happiness, but the environment you live in can also have a huge impact on your wellbeing. Yet, what exactly makes a \"happy city\"?\nTo find out, researchers at the Institute for the Quality of Life recently released their2025 Happy City Index, tracking 82 indicators of happiness across six major categories including Citizens, Governance, Environment, Economy, Health and Mobility. The index measured the policies that contribute to the quality of life, as well as their implementation and impact on residents.\nThe index noted that no city should ultimately be considered \"the happiest\", instead naming a group of 31 cities that made the \"Gold Cities\" list, indicating especially strong scores across all metrics. To find out what kind of policies and features truly make up a \"happy city\", we spoke to residents living in the five top-scoring places around the world.\nDenmark frequently ranks in thehappiest countries index, so perhaps it's no surprise that its capital city received the highest overall score. Copenhagen scores exceptionally well in the Environment category, which ranks its green spaces, sustainability and waste management; and the Economy category, which factors in items like GDP, median salary and overall innovation and international company presence.\nThe city also ranked well in the Citizens category, which includes cultural resources like libraries and museums, as well as resident engagement and events. For permanent resident Mari-Anne Daura, the lively food and cultural scene keeps her loving where she lives.\n\"The city is always organising free events, whether it'sThe Copenhagen Light Festival,The Human Library,Copenhagen Cookingor theDistortion Street Parties. I appreciate how much effort the city puts into curating experiences for its residents,\" she said. \"There is always something to do and something new to experience, which is what made me choose to live in Copenhagen over Stockholm.\"\nResidents also appreciate Copenhagen's emphasis on alternate and safe modes of transport. \"Nearly one-third or more of the population bikes and the city itself has its own bike lane, which many people use to commute to and from the city. The metro system also runs like clockwork,\" said resident Aaron Wertheimer.\nHe recommends visitors rent a bike and cycle over the Hans Christian Andersen bridge. \"You can see the entire city, its canals and its beautiful architecture, and you'll gain a greater appreciation for the city's aesthetic and overall atmosphere,\" he said.\nDaura recommends hopping on a water bus to experience the city from another angle. \"Check out the vibe and the wide variety of food trucks atReffen[Northern Europe's largest street food market],\" she said. \"To me, nothing is more Copenhagen than Reffen.\"\nRanked second highest in the index, Switzerland's largest city received especially high marks in the Citizens category as well as the Governance category, which measures citizen participation in government policies and access to digital services to improve life for residents.\nThis overall ease of living makes it much more stress-free, according to residents. \"As a mum of two, Zurich is the perfect place to raise a family,\" said resident Raquel Matos Gonçalves, who helps residents relocate to Switzerland through her companyExpat You. \"The main pain points of daily life are fully addressed: very safe (kids can go to school alone from kindergarten); public transport that is always on time; and Zurich is an exceptionally clean and organised city.\"\nShe adds: \"All these aspects make daily life so easy, so predictable, that they absorb the stress you'd otherwise experience.\"\nThe city has clear rules and guidelines, too. \"The unofficial motto is 'If it doesn't say yes, assume it's a no,'\" said resident Amelie Guiot, meaning that everyone stays within the bounds of the law and rules, keeping infrastructure like streets and public transport orderly and clean. She also appreciates the free drinking water from the city's 1,000-plus public fountains.\nGuiot recommends visitors check out theKunsthaus Zürich, Switzerland's biggest art museum – though the city has more than 50 other museums for more niche interests. On a sunny day, everyone migrates to lakesidebadis(public bathhouses). \"My favourite isFrauenbad Stadthausquai, a women-only wooden bathhouse,\" she said.\nThe city-state of Singapore often ranks high in various indexes, especially as one of thehappiest countries in Asiadue to its ease of doing business, cleanliness and infrastructure. In the 2025 Happiest City Index, it scored particularly well in the newly created Health metric, which tracks overall safety, public health initiatives like vaccinations and financial protection for health expenses.\nIt also ranked high in Governance, a metric where residents have seen policies ease the cost-of-living burden that has plagued other cities around the world. \"While Singapore has become really expensive, a good and early public housing scheme (HDB) along with rising housing prices has helped many Singaporeans to have not only a home but a financial asset that could potentially be cashed out for retirement or emergencies,\" said resident Hwee-Boon Yar. \"The tiny island's size and neighbours has been a strong force to ensure the city stays competitive, yet friendly with other countries.\"\nResidents also appreciate how the city's infrastructure makes it easy to enjoy life. \"Beyond convenience, Singapore's policies around green space, safety and multicultural inclusivity really stand out. You can go from pitching a global client downtown to enjoying satay by the waterfront, all in the same evening,\" says resident Samuel Huang who owns a Singapore-based business.\nFor first-time visitors, he recommends a walk through the hip neighborhood of Tiong Bahru, \"where history, food and design meet local life in the most charming way possible\", he said.\nAs Denmark's second-largest city, Aarhus often gets called the \"world's smallest big city\", something that helps residents stay happy by combining urban amenities with a small community feel. The city scored well across all metrics, but especially in Citizens, Environment and Health – factors that residents say come across in the ease of life here.\n\"Joy is seamlessly woven into daily life – not through extravagance, but through intentional design,\" said resident Carla Niña Pornelos. \"I remember cycling to a community dinner on a rooftop garden overlooking the harbour, realising how accessible happiness can be when a city genuinely supports wellbeing.\"\nMore like this:\n•Why Switzerland is home to two of the world's most liveable cities\n•What it's like to live in the happiest country on Earth\n•Why Icelanders are happier than ever\nShe mentions integrated bike lanes, green spaces and free public events that foster a sense of community. The city also prides itself on sustainability initiatives likedistrict heatingandwaste-to-energy programmes, while healthcare and education are both accessible and high-quality. \"It's not just the infrastructure, though,\" she said. \"It's the sense that people trust each other and their institutions.\"\nHome to multiple universities, the city also has an energetic feeling that especially arises after Denmark's long winter. \"When spring and summer come around, everyone comes out of hibernation ready to hang out in the parks, swim at the harbour baths or grab a beer by the canal,\" said local Mathias Steen. \"There's such a warm, laid-back vibe; people are everywhere, and the city feels alive.\"\nTo get a sense of the city, Pornelos recommends visitors take a walk along theInfinite Bridgeat sunrise. \"It's a circular pier that stretches out into the sea – quiet, surreal and emblematic of the Danish way of blending nature, art and thoughtful urban planning,\" she said. \"That single moment captures what it's like to live here: balanced, beautiful and profoundly human.\"\nAntwerp managed to inch out larger sister-city Brussels in the Happy Cities index, with higher scores in the Citizens, Government and Environment categories. Residents praise its reliable public transportation, its safe and easy cycling and its compact size – all of which making getting around quick and easy.\n\"I moved to Antwerp in my late 20s expecting a charming city with good food and beautiful architecture, but I've stayed because of how livable it is,\" said resident Grace Carter. \"There's a calm efficiency here that you start to feel in your day-to-day.\"\nShe also notes that the city invests in progressive policies like support for working families, social housing and sustainability that make life easier and more enjoyable. \"What really surprised me was how seriously Antwerp takes its green spaces and cultural life,\" she added. \"From the riverside parks to the world-class museums, it's a place where people genuinely make time to enjoy life, not just work through it.\"\nTo best see the city, she says it's worth skipping the city's well-trod museum trail to visit theSaturday market at Theaterplein. \"Grab a coffee, listen to the local chatter and just soak up that relaxed, quietly confident vibe that makes Antwerp feel like home.\" "

    "title": "The great conclave secret: What do would-be popes eat?",
    "content": "For more than 750 years, strict rules have guarded what cardinals can and cannot eat to prevent hidden messages stuffed inside chicken, ravioli and napkins.\nThis past week, travellers in Rome may have spotted cardinals frequenting their favourite restaurants. Just before thelast papal election in 2013, Italian media reported that many of these men were making the time to visit a particular neighbourhood favourite,Al Passetto di Borgo, a family-run eatery located 200m from Saint Peter's Basilica, where Cardinal Donald William Wuerl is known to order the lasagna and Francesco Coccopalmerio (allegedly themost-voted Italian cardinalin 2013) likes the grilled squid.\nCardinals may feel some urgency to get in a good meal or two because, during theconclavebeginning on 7 May, in which 135 cardinals will hold a secret election for a new pope in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, they'll be entirely secluded from the rest of the world for an indefinite period of time. Voting, sleeping and eating all take place in tightly controlled sequestration.\nPapal conclaves are notoriously secretive affairs. The cardinals are secured in a single shared space with no messages allowed in or out, except for the smoke signalling whether a vote has been successful. White smoke signals a new pope and black means another vote is required to reach the two-thirds-plus-one consensus required to crown a new pontiff. What precisely occurs in these conclaves is unknown, but one thing is certain: the cardinals must eat over the days or weeks it takes to elect the new leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.\nBut with provisions going in and out, how is the secrecy of the conclave maintained? How can the cardinals ensure the integrity of the vote, unaffected by outside opinion?\nHistorically, food has presented a potential risk: a cardinal's ravioli might be stuffed with an illicit message from the kitchen staff; or a cardinal could sneak a vote update to the outside world with a dirty napkin. However, communal eating is also one of the contexts in which furtive negotiations can take place. Recent pop culture representations have made the most of this, using conclave food culture to create a heightened sense of suspicion, intrigue and control.\nTake the 2024 filmConclave, where almost all the plot points occur not in the voting chambers, but in the cafeteria. The noisy meals contrast with the almost entirely silent conclave proper, which proceeds without formal debates. The otherwise silent voting is only sparingly punctuated by moments of ritual speech, like the audible oath a cardinal takes as he drops his voting card into the ballot urn. Still, around the ceremonial silence is a great deal of communication, much of which happens with and via food. And while we can't assume that the film faithfully depicts what happens behind closed doors, it is no doubt true that in papal food culture – as in culture more broadly – what you eat, how you eat and with whom you eat speaks volumes.\nThe code of conclave secrecy goes back to 1274, when Pope Gregory X established the regulations that still partly dictate how papal elections are run today. As with the coronation of many popes, his was controversial. It also had the distinction of being by far the longest, taking almost three years (1268-1271) to reach the majority consensus required to appoint a new pope. According to Italian canonist Henricus de Segusio, who served in that conclave, local residents threatened to restrict the cardinals' food to hasten a resolution.\nPope Gregory X's new rules included isolation of the conclave – a rule that is still in effect today – and rationing of the cardinals' food. After three days without consensus, the cardinals received only one daily meal; after eight days, only bread and water. In the mid-1300s, these rules were relaxed by Clement VI, who permitted three-course meals consisting of soup; a main dish of fish, meat or eggs; and dessert, which could include cheese or fruit. While the rationing didn't stick, tight control over conclaves remains.\nThe most detailed historical account of the food culture of papal conclaves comes fromBartolomeo Scappi, who was the Renaissance's most famous chef (and arguably the world's first celebrity chef) and served both Popes Pius IV and Pius V. His 1570 book,Opera Dell'Arte del Cucinare(The Art of Cooking) – the first cookbook published by a practicing chef – catapulted him to fame. In it, he reveals the secrets of feeding the conclave that elected Pope Julius III, and the extreme practice of surveillance that remains to this day.\nMore like this:\n•Testaccio: The foodie neighbourhood where Romans go to eat\n•Where Rome's insider foodie Katie Parla queen eats in her hometown\n•An Italian cultural ambassador's guide to Rome\nAccording to Scappi, the cardinals' daily meals were prepared in a communal kitchen by cooks and sommeliers, just two of the many domestic positions that kept a conclave functioning. He identifies that the kitchen was a space where illicit messages could be shared, and notes that guards were stationed there specifically to prevent this. Therefore, twice a day in an order determined by lottery, stewards would ceremoniously bring the food to theruota. This \"wheel\" or turntable, built into the wall, allowed food and drink to be passed to the cardinals in their inner hall. Before being passed through the wall, food and drinks were checked by testers to ensure they were not hiding any illicit messages. Every step was closely watched by Italian and Swiss guards.\nThe foodstuffs were strictly controlled, with nothing permitted that might obscure a secret message. No closed pies. No whole chickens. Wine and water had to be offered in clear glass, not in opaque vessels. Cloth napkins were opened and carefully inspected.\nThis arrangement was partly to ensure the complete isolation of the cardinals, and partly to assuage concerns about poisoning. After all, especially during the Renaissance, the papacy was a highly influential political position.\nStrict protocol and food restrictions aside, the meals Scappi describes sound bountiful and balanced, including salad, fruit, charcuterie, wine and fresh water. Likewise, he describes comfortable accommodations for the cardinals. Each had their own large cell, decorated with silk and amply furnished with a bed, a table, a clothing rack, two stools, a chamber pot and a lockable jar, among many other items. By Scappi's account, serving in a Renaissance papal conclave wasn't a bad gig – so long as you didn't mind constant surveillance.\nFor the upcoming conclave starting on 7 May, the nuns at theDomus Sanctae Marthae– the modern residence where cardinals live during their sequestration – will prepare simple dishes characteristic of Lazio, the Italian region surrounding the Vatican, and nearby Abruzzo: minestrone, spaghetti,arrosticini(lamb skewers) and boiled vegetables. While this may seem to differ from Renaissance conclaves where meals were prepared by secular domestics operating under strict protocol and close guard, the result is the same: the process is closely controlled, ensuring no information can get in or out.\nIn the first of several kitchen scenes that appear in Conclave, the film makes a point of showing nuns boiling whole chickens for broth – hardly luxurious fare. But it's the symbolism that's important. The modern Catholic church – especially coming out of the leadership of Pope Francis – hopes to communicate a simple, wholesome image. Concerns about the potential for food (whole chickens, specifically) to contain literal secret messages have faded. It's illicit communication through electronic means, another recurring symbol in the film, that's the concern now.\nSo, while the Vatican is being swept for hidden electronic devices in preparation for the upcoming conclave, the cardinals will do their own personal preparations, venturing into Rome to linger over a favourite dish or two, perhaps wondering whether it will be their last supper before becoming pope.

    "title": "The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'",
    "content": "You can’t book them and you don't know who else will be there, but they're an excellent way to explore Britain's most remote corners – for free.\nHiking up to the top of a valley in Wales'Cambrian Mountains, I was struck by the silence. The noise of the modern world that we've trained ourselves to filter out becomes conspicuous by its absence. This is probably the best indication that you've entered one of Britain's remote places, and a good sign if you're trying to find a bothy, one of the free-to-use shelters that dot the country's wild areas.\nFounded in 1965, theMountain Bothy Association (MBA)is a registered charity that maintains \"simple shelters in remote country for the use of all who love wild and lonely places\". The organisation manages more than 100 bothies in Scotland, Wales and Northern England.\nThe system is simple. Bothies are free to use and open to anyone. They can't be booked in advance, and there's an unwritten rule that the bothy is never full (although groups of six or more and commercial groups are asked not to use them). As long as you follow the MBA'sBothy Code, which is based on respect for other users, the bothy and the surroundings, you're welcome.\nThat is if you can find them. Although the grid references are availableonline, don't count on phone signal when looking for them, and even with a well-marked map, they can prove elusive.\nI was hiking a network of trails in an area known as the \"Green Desert of Wales\" because of its lack of settlements, roads and infrastructure. I planned to sleep atNant Syddion bothybefore heading to Aberystwyth, the largest nearby town, the next day. Given the relative scarcity of buildings in the landscape, I'd expected to locate the bothy easily. But climbing up and down a succession of forestry tracks as the sun began to set, I began to wonder if I was going to find it at all.\nWith relief, I finally caught the reflection of a window through the trees and climbed down a steep path to a two-storey stone building that looked like a home transported into the middle of nowhere, complete with a spiral of smoke climbing out of the chimney. And that's exactly what it was. Nant Syddion used to be home to a lead miner and his family and now provides a temporary home for hikers.\nEvery bothy is an adapted building with a previous life. Most are old shepherd's huts, farmsteads or workers' accommodation. In the early 20th Century, hill farming declined and fewer and fewer people lived in remote locations, leaving many buildings derelict. After World War Two, hiking and mountaineering as leisure pursuits dramatically increased in popularity and those exploring the outdoors began using these abandoned buildings as shelters. The MBA was created by Bernard Heath and a group of friends to restore and maintain them for like-minded individuals.\nRemote upland country takes its toll on buildings; the wind and rain age, erode and wear almost everything. However, arriving at the bothy, I found that everything was watertight and functional. Even the gate and the front door had recently been painted.\nKeeping 100 buildings habitable in some of the remotest parts of Britain is no mean feat. When you factor in that this work is all done by volunteers (and where bothies have toilets, it involves carrying the waste out), it's a step beyond altruism. Each bothy has two maintenance organisers, and work parties are organised for any large-scale or structural jobs, which, Neil Stewart, head of communications at the MBA, told me, are rarely lacking in willing hands.\nAlthough they're maintained, bothies are by no means luxurious. You won't find electricity or running water and will be lucky to have a long-drop toilet. Most will have a stove, but there's no guarantee a supply of fuel will be there. Your comforts are carried in, and you should pack as if you're camping, including a tent if the bothy is overcrowded or you don't fancy the company.\nThe company you find in bothies, and the fact that it's completely unpredictable, is one of their unique attractions, according to Phoebe Smith, authorThe Book of the Bothy. \"In a world where everything is bookable and controllable, I love that you can't do that with a bothy,\" she said. \"You just have to go and turn up, and you could have it all to yourself or you could meet some incredible people and share some incredible memories. [Bothies] connect you with other people.\"\nWhen I arrived at Nant Syddion, there were already two cyclists in the main room who were doing an off-road tour of the area. I laid out my roll mat and sleeping bag in the last unoccupied upstairs room and went to join them.\nAfter introducing myself to the cyclists, Alex and Simon, I prepared a quick meal over my gas stove while they battled to get the fire to take. Built to withstand its exposed position, the bothy had thick walls and small windows, so when the light began to disappear, it got dark quickly. We lit a succession of candles and arranged our chairs in a semicircle around the roaring fire.\nOne of the best parts of bothying for me is that people are drawn to socialise together – although you're under no obligation if you want your own space. As we warmed up by the fire, one, then two bottles of whisky (something of a traditional drink for bothies) did the round and stories began to flow. We talked about recent hiking trips in the Dolomites and our bothy experiences, arriving at one to find it full of ex-soldiers in the middle of a reunion drinking session. Hours passed and laughter continued until we remembered we had to hike and cycle back out the next day, and reluctantly left the warmth of the main room to sleep.\nA feature of every bothy is the bothy book, where people record their experiences and motivations for visiting. The next morning, I read through accounts ranging from people sheltering from the rain to alleged supernatural happenings. There was an entry roughly every couple of days, indicating a steady flow of people passing through.\nHowever, it's only been in the last decade and a half that bothies have shifted away from being something of a closed society. In 2009, the locations of the MBA bothies were shared online by the organisation. \"It used to be quite a secretive organisation in the sense that people found out where the bothies were by joining the association or just coming across them in the wilderness areas,\" Stewart explained. \"But that was unsustainable with the internet and people using the outdoors. And it was against our charitable aim. If we're providing buildings for people to use, it's logical we have to tell them where they are, we can't leave them secret.\"\nThis move wasn't unanimously popular. Part of the concern was that the people might begin using these spaces as places to party as opposed to a shelter while enjoying outdoor pursuits. But, as Stewart told me, it's not a problem that's unique to bothies. \"We have had examples of drinking parties in bothies, but we're not particularly bothered with that… There are problems with wild camping in many areas of the country. Up in Scotland, there's a ban on wild camping in one of the national parks because people were littering, leaving rubbish [and] cutting down trees for fires.\"\nMore like this:\n•Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n•The US homes made from waste materials\n•Norway's simple answer to greener, cleaner living\nThe MBA has no way of accurately recording visitor numbers, but anecdotal evidence from their maintenance teams suggests their use has increased with the greater availability of information around them. Smith said, \"There's a whole debate to be had, but the fact of the matter was that bothy users and volunteers, who were fixing them and repairing them, were ageing out and we need younger people coming in.\"\nWhile the locations of the MBA bothies are no longer a mystery, these aren't the only bothies that exist in the UK. There are others, maintained by estates or climbing clubs, where the old system of secrecy endures. As well as the adventure of seeking out hidden bothies whose locations still can't be found online, every bothy experience is unique. With a constantly changing cast of people seeking shelter, the sheer unpredictability is a rare chance in the modern world to embrace serendipity, and that's what inspires me to continue seeking them out.\nHiking out the next morning, I stopped at the bend in the track behind which the bothy would be lost in the trees. It would remain open the next night and the next, for anyone needing shelter, and I thought about all the stories and experiences I'd read through in the bothy book. The MBA network continues to grow and develop. Compostable toilets are being added to more sites, and Stewart shared that two new bothies are currently in the pipeline. That means plenty more stories to come. "

    "title": "The South American country supplying Mother's Day flowers",
    "content": "Every May, millions of flowers make their way to mums across the US for Mother's Day, and the majority come from one nation.\nSo, where do these flowers come from?\nThat would be Colombia, which exportsmore than $2bnworth of cut flowers each year, making it the second-largest flower producer in the world after the Netherlands, and the largest single supplier to the United States. Nearly 80% of Colombia's flowers (or $1.62bn) end up in the US, so if you're Stateside, chances are that the stems in your Mother's Day bouquets originated in this South American country.\nA 2024articlein the American Journal of Transportation noted that in just 21 days, more than 400 LATAM Airlines flights carrying 24,000 tonnes of flowers (roughly 552 million flower stems), took off from Colombia and neighbouring Ecuador. But thanks to rising inflation and US President Donald Trump issuinga 10% baseline tariffon most all imported goods from Colombia, many experts say that Mother's Day bouquets arelikely to be more expensivein the US this year.\n\"Flowers are not something we can buy in advance and hold on to, they have to be cut fresh,\" shopping expert Trae Bodge recentlytold The Today Show. \"Consumers are really going to feel that pinch when they're buying flowers [this year].\"\nPrior to the 1960s, most American bouquet-bound flowers were cut fresh in California, but they were expensive. Colombia's modern floral export industry traces its roots back to the Cold War. Then in 1961, US President John F Kennedy created the $100bnAlliance for Progressinitiative, which aimed to combat the threat of communism by enhancing economic cooperation between the US and Latin America.Colombia became a key focus of the administration, and one of the programme's first tasks was to help Colombia develop its agricultural industry.\nKennedy even visited Colombia's capital, Bogotá, in 1961, whennearly one-thirdof the city's 1.5 million people swarmed the streets to catch a glimpse of the US President and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It was the largest reception JFK had while in office, and today, one of the city's densest neighbourhoods is still namedKennedy.\nThings began to bloom in the 1970s when improvements in air transportation made it easier to connect Colombia's fertile soil with the booming demand for flowers in the US and abroad. Entrepreneur and floriculture hobbyist Edgar Wells, whose export company sent the first shipment of cut flowers from Bogota to Miami in 1965, once compared Colombia's flower industry to the mythical legend of El Dorado, saying: \"After 400 years, the true riches of El Dorado have been discovered … a permanent source of riches for all Colombians, for all time.\"\nIn 1991, the industry got an additional boost with the passage of theAndean Trade Preference Act(ATPA), which offered many South American countries a way to import a wide variety of goods duty-free, including flowers. The country now exports billions of flowers to the US every year, and despiteproblematic labour practicesand adwindling work force, it still specialises in growing some of the most popular flowers found in bouquets or given as gifts – including roses, carnations and orchids.\nThe impressive breadth of flowers grown in Colombia is partly due to the country's unique landscapes. The countryside surrounding city of Facatativá, outside of Bogota, is a hotspot for flower farms. The area's setting on a high plain savanna in the shadow of the Andes mountains makes an ideal space for flower growing, with more than73% of Colombia's floral productiontaking place there. Further north, the area around Medellín accounts for an additional 24%.\nSince 1957, Medellín has celebrated its growing floral heritage with the annualFeria de las Flores(Flower Festival), which is now the biggest cultural event in the city. Known as the \"city of eternal spring\" because of its beautiful year-round weather, Medellín explodes with colour every August as the 10-day flower festival kicks off. The event, which takes place in downtown Medellín, features food, artists, vendors and – of course – flowers.\nMore like this:\n•A local expert's guide to seeing the most beautiful tulips in the Netherlands\n•A journey to Earth's most remote flower\n•The flower that blooms every 12 years\nThe festival is best known for the elaboratesilleterosparade. The term silleteros, or \"saddle men\", refers to the practice of men carrying goods on large circular plates worn on their backs. The tradition started as a way to transport produce, goods and even people through the mountainous terrain of the Andes, however it has become synonymous with flower sellers in Colombia because of the use of these back plates to transport flowers from farms in the mountains to the cities where they're sold.\nDuring the flower festival, silleteros create elaborate artistic floral arrangements, which often depict important historical and cultural moments with flowers and carry them through the streets on these traditional plates.\nA more common, but no less beautiful, way to experience Colombia's floral heritage is by visiting one of the many flower markets in cities around the country. For example, one of Medellín’s famous farmers' markets, thePlacita de Flóressells locally grown flowers alongside other goods and produce, as does theMercado de Paloquemaoin Bogotá. Some flower farms, also welcomeguests, so that visitors can see exactly where their favourite blooms originate, while also directly supporting the people who grow them.\nThis article was originally published in 2024 and has since been updated.

    "title": "What you need to know about US Real ID",
    "content": "Starting 7 May, many American citizens and residents will need a new form of ID to board domestic flights.\nThis week, the US government is set to implement a major change to its air travel policy that has been nearly 20 years in the making.\nStarting 7 May, US citizens and residents will no longer be able to use a standard driver's licence or state ID to board domestic flights. Instead, travellers will need to present aREAL ID, passport or other acceptable form of identification at airport security checkpoints.\nHere's what you need to know.\nThe new REAL ID is a federally compliant licence or non-driver ID issued by a state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that meets new security standards at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints. The new IDs look very similar to existing driver's licences or state IDs but are recognisable by a gold or black star located in the top-right corner.\n\"The Real ID requirement bolsters safety by making fraudulent IDs harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists,\" Adam Stahl, TSA Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator explained in astatement. \"TSA will implement REAL ID effectively and efficiently, continuing to ensure the safety and security of passengers while also working to minimise operational disruptions at airports.\"\nAll American travellers over the age of 18 will be required to present a REAL ID or anotherTSA-acceptable form of identification, such as a passport or permanent resident card, in order to board domestic flights anywhere in the US and its territories.\nEven travellers with TSA PreCheck, are not exempt from these requirements. However, children under the age of 18 are still allowed to fly domestically without identification.\nTo obtain a REAL ID, travellers should usethis mapand click on their home state or territory to determine what specific documentation they'll need to apply. Most travellers will generally need to make an appointment at their local DMV and bring in documents that prove their identity and lawful status. These may include proof of identity and citizenship via a passport, birth certificate or green card; proof of address in the form of utility bills or bank statements; and a social security card.\nApplicants will be issued temporary identification while the REAL ID is processed and mailed, which can take several weeks. The cost to obtain the new ID varies from state to state, so it's recommended to check with the local Department of Motor Vehicles.\nAmerican travellers without a REAL ID, passport or other acceptable form of identification will be subject to additional screening and may be turned away and not allowed to board their flights. According to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)website, without a REAL ID: \"The TSA officer may ask you to complete an identity verification process, which includes collecting information such as your name and current address to confirm your identity.\"\nMore like this:\n•The big changes coming to UK and European travel in 2025\n•The digital aircraft: How technology is reshaping air travel\n•How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\nIn addition to a passport, the DHS website notes that anenhanced IDor a DHS-trusted traveller card such as Global Entry may be presented in lieu of a REAL ID. However, the DHS warns that this list is subject to change, so travellers should be sure to double check with TSA to confirm before arriving at the airport.\nFollowing the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 9/11 Commission recommended the US Congress pass theREAL ID Actin order to establish more stringent security standards for driver's licences and other identification documents. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and opposition from state governments, led to several postponements of the REAL ID rollout since the Act was originally passed.\nWhile the rule only applies directly to American travellers, it's believed that anyone travelling within the US may be affected by these new requirements, as longer lines are expected at airport security checkpoints. Travellers are encouraged to arrive early for flights in order to accommodate potential longer wait times and additional screenings, ideally two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international flights.

    "title": "Why now is the time to explore outer East London",
    "content": "A few miles from East London's perennially hip neighbourhoods, an explosion of art and culture is transforming a once-neglected stretch into one of the city's hottest destinations.\nEast London. Two words that, if you know anything about the UK's capital, often conjure up opposing opinions.\nThere are those who mourn its supposedlywaning hip factor– regaling stories of 1980s warehouse art shows or squat parties – while deploring the rampant commercialism of its supercharged epicentre, Shoreditch. Others, meanwhile, will rave about new independent galleries or small-plate restaurants in nearby Dalston, Bethnal Green or Hackney. Yet, the general consensus is that East London's long-buzzing arts and food scenes are continuing to move ever further out, driven – as in other world cities – by the relentless search for affordability.\nBut a few miles east of these oversubscribed neighbourhoods are two boroughs that are lesser known to visitors and have been quietly emerging as London's next artsy enclave: Waltham Forest and Newham. Stretching north from Stratford up to Leyton and Walthamstow, this  once-unfashionable outer area hasn't always matched East London's brand of cool. And yet in spring 2025, it's witnessing a cultural explosion, with new museums, theatres and bars and some of the city's biggest arts openings that are putting this under-the-radar corner of London on the map.\nThe catalyst for these boroughs' rise was the 2012 London Olympics, which transformed the area's scrapyards and brownfield land intoQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park– an oasis of rivers, canals and water meadows bordered by Stratford, Leyton and Hackney.\n\"The Olympics brought a huge amount of investment in infrastructure, transport links and housing,\" said Britannia Morton, co-chief executive of Sadler's Wells, the world-famous Islington-based dance theatre founded in the 18th Century. \"The Olympic Park, where our newSadler's Wells Eastis based, was created converting marshland into this beautiful environment.\"\nSadler's Wells East, which opened in February 2025, is located in East Bank, a £1.1bn new waterside cultural quarter in the Olympic Park. \"[It was] formerly known as Fridge Mountain – a dumping ground for old electronic appliances,\" said Morton. The first landmark to open here was theUniversity of the Arts' London College of Fashionin October 2023, which has galleries and a cafe open to the public. Sadler's Wells East was built in Italian red brick and houses a 550-seat state-of-the-art auditorium and six dance studios.\n\"Whether you're interested in ballet, hip-hop, kathak or contemporary, our eclectic programme brings the most innovative work created locally, nationally and internationally to Stratford,\" said Morton. Visitors can enjoyfree eventsin its public spaces, including lunchtime dance classes on the community dance floor, as well as a bar and restaurant. There are panoramic views from its rooftop over theLondon Aquatics Centre, Sir Anish Kapoor's 114.5mArcelorMittal Orbit(the UK's largest sculpture) and theLondon Stadium.\nAcross the park at theHere Eastinnovation and tech campus (formerly the London Olympics Media Centre) is the glass-frontedV&A East Storehouse, opening 31 May 2025. It's the first half of the new V&A East, whose South Kensington-basedoriginalis the world's largest museum of applied arts, decorative arts and design, with more than 2.8 million objects in its permanent collection.\nThis first instalment is essentially a new home for the V&A East's reserve collection (hence the name \"Storehouse\"), and \"a magical new behind-the-scenes museum experience\", according to its deputy director and COO Tim Reeve. With 100 curated mini displays, its half a million works range from the Glastonbury Festival Archive to Dior haute couture and mid-century furniture. Its world-firstOrder an Objectexperience allows anyone to book an appointment to view anything from Roman frescoes to Elton John's costumes. It will also be home to the newDavid Bowie Centre, opening 13 September 2025, displaying the singer's outfits, lyrics and archive.\n\"It's a new standard for access to national collections,\" said Reeve. \"We're encouraging visitors to feel empowered to make their own journeys through the V&A's global collections.\"\nThe second half, the five-storey V&A East Museum, is opening in East Bank in spring 2026. Its main exhibition hall will celebrate leading artists, designers and performers in major shows, and its galleries will narrate stories of East London's creative and manufacturing heritage.\nElsewhere in East Bank,BBC Music Studios, which will house the BBC Symphony Orchestra and host recording sessions and live performances, is slated to open in late 2026 or early 2027.\nAnd that's not all. A couple of miles north in Walthamstow, another major cultural opening is happening. While this diverse north-east London suburb has long been thriving – its pretty village centre, some of which dates to the 15th Century, is indeed a gentrification hotspot – the imposing newSoho Theatre Walthamstowwill further raise the neighbourhood's profile when it opens on 2 May 2025. A former cinema designed in 1930 by architect Cecil Masey, the distinctive building was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the 13th-Century Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. In its mid-20th-Century heyday, it also hosted gigs by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones – before closing in 2003.\nMore like this:\n•London Overground: Four stops to explore the 'real' London\n•Five unusual historical experiences in London\n•See another side to London at eight of its most unusual tourist attractions\nWhen it finally reopens, with its original Art Deco stylings revived, the Soho Theatre Walthamstow will have a 960-seat Grade II-listed auditorium, studio spaces, four bars and a restaurant. (In comparison, its current West End location has a capacity of just 240.)\n\"This is the first time we've had a professional theatre in the area,\" said executive assistant Annie Jones, who worked on the restoration project for more than five years. \"The programme will list up to nine shows a night – a mix of comedy, cabaret and theatre all rooted in its community. Waltham Forest has always been welcoming, with its vibrancy, multiculturalism and openness, and its spirit has only grown.\"\nConnecting Stratford, the Olympic Park and Walthamstow is Leyton. This once-maligned area is now home to one of the most up-and-coming strips in East London. Previously more synonymous with fly-tipping, Tilbury Road railway arches (a narrow alleyway opposite Leyton Midland Road station) has been transformed by new arrivals in the last year alone, including three bars, a bakery, a Caribbean restaurant and two soon-to-open artisan cafes. The opening of two popular microbreweries in the last few years on the same stretch sparked this sudden transformation:Gravity Well, nestled in the station arch itself, and the edgierLibertaliataproom, named after a mythical anarchist colony in the 17th Century.\nFor Leyton-raised Danny Saunders, owner of tropical cocktail barLeyton Calling(which opened in summer 2024) and cosy candlelit pubChop Shop Tavern(which opened in February 2025), it's a personal coup, having known the area since the 1980s. \"I've come full circle,\" he said, with a smile. \"My latest bar is in the actual arch where I set up my first car repair business back in the day.\"\nLeyton's rise as a whole has, however, been something of a slow-burn. Back in the mid-2010s, nearby Francis Road began to be taken over by independent creative businesses. \"I opened here in 2017,\" said Aimée Madill, who ownsPhlox, a bookstore, cafe and wine bar. \"It was risky as it was still a 'less-developed' part of London, but local indie bookshops are more than a business, they're a sign of confidence in a community.\"\nPedestrianised in 2017, the tree-lined street has since blossomed with chic cafes and bars: two of the latest openings are vinyl store-cum-craft beer barDreamhouse RecordsandLoop Dining, a pop-up space launched in summer 2024 to host weekly residencies from buzzy up-and-coming chefs.\n\"Unlike Stratford,\" Madill said, \"Leyton is characterised by small makers and creatives existing side by side with businesses who've been here decades. Most of us live here, so we've been able to revitalise, rather than reinvent, parts of the area – which adds to the sense of community.\"\nSo what's next for outer East London? \"Young people and families are now priced out of Hackney,\" said Michaela Zelenanska, who runs natural wine barSwirl, which opened in December 2024 on Tilbury Road. \"Leyton and neighbouring Leytonstone seem a logical next big thing. It's small businesses that make the place what it is.\"\nWill London continue to move ever further east? \"We're already engaging with artists, audiences and community groups in Barking and Dagenham,\" said Morton, referencing two outer London suburbs several miles from Leyton and Stratford.\"East London has always been a creative crucible.\"\nStephen Emms is an East London resident who writes a weekly newsletter calledLeytonstonerabout the arts, food and drink scenes primarily in Leyton, Leytonstone, Stratford and Walthamstow.
