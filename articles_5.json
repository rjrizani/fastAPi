    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "Mürren: The stunning car-free village reached by cable car",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "Throughout history, this medieval hamlet has remained relatively secluded from the outside world. But now, the world's steepest cable car whisks travellers to the 430-person village.\nOn a freezing day in December 2024, I took a scenic three-hour train ride from Geneva toLauterbrunnen, an Alpine village nestled betweenInterlakenand the Jungfrau massif in central Switzerland. I was now at the gateway to the car-free mountain hamletofMürren.\nFor most of Mürren's history, residents would lead their mules three hours down to gather essential supplies in the valley before trekking back up. Then in 1891, a narrow-gauge railway opened, connecting Mürren to the nearby mountain village of Grütschalp and a funicular that reached Lauterbrunnen. In 1965, a single-track cableway opened that could ferry residents down to another traffic-free village, Gimmelwald, above the valley.\nBut the day I arrived, this formerly secluded 430-person hamlet perched 1638m in theBernese Oberlandbecame directly connected with the outside world and valley below through the opening of the world's steepest cable car: theSchilthornbahn, which whisks travellers 775m up through some of the Swiss Alps' most jaw-dropping scenery in just four minutes.\nAfter arriving at theStechelberg car park,I was soon being hoisted from the valley floor up in a glass-enclosed cabin, staring down towards the storybook cottages below and surrounded by craggy mountains and snow-covered pines. The trip up the vertical Mürrenfluh rockface was so smooth that I barely noticed the 159.4% gradient (the world's previous steepest cable car, theLoen Skyliftin Norway, rises 133%), until my ears started to pop.\nPerched on a natural terrace at the foot of theSchilthornsummit (2970m) overlooking the Lauterbrunnen valley, Mürren is a 13th-Century village with traditional stone and timber cottages that looks like it's clinging to the edge of a cliff. Because of its unique position, engineers have never been able to connect it to the outside world by road.\n\"Taking the cable car to school might seem unusual to many, but it was an everyday ritual for me,\" said Mürren native Michael Abegglen. \"Most everyday necessities and services are available in Mürren, but every time we need a doctor, hairdresser or dentist, we need to go down to the valley where many of us have our cars parked.\"\nAccording to Abegglen, the village's few year-round residents have long relied on one another. \"When you grow up here like I did, you know almost everyone, and there's a strong close-knit community,\" Abegglen adds. \"Some guests are like locals, as they return to Mürren every single year.\"\nAfter checking into theHotel Alpenruh, and admiring the awe-inspiring, 360-degree views of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau peaks from my balcony, I soon discovered that – unsurprisingly – this pocket-sized, car-free village is best explored on foot.\nMürren's few streets are lined with cosy inns; rustic restaurants serving Alpine cheeses and dry sausages; bars offering evening aperitifs; and quaint souvenir shops selling postcards, fine Swiss chocolates, cuckoo clocks and cowbells. One of Mürren's main landmarks is theHotel Mürren Palace, built in 1874 and nicknamed \"Switzerland's first palace\" after its history of hosting celebrity skiers and Hollywood actors like Rita Hayworth. Oozing elegance and grandeur, its ballroom served as a meeting point for high society back in the 20th Century. As the snow fell, I popped into the pub at theEiger Guesthouseto warm up over a mug ofglühwein(traditional mulled wine).\nDespite its diminutive size, Mürren is a major winter sports hub. This former sleepyWalser settlementtransformed in the late 1800s when British skiers discovered the village and fell in love with its scenery (and slopes).\n\"My great-grandfather Henry Lunn first came to Mürren in the 1890s and was smitten by its breathtaking beauty,\" said Bernard Lunn, a self-proclaimed \"ski bum\" and village resident. \"He soon started bringing British tourists here to witness the glorious 'triumvirate' of [the] Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau peaks. Later, my mountaineer grandfather Arnold Lunn and his wife Mabel started living here, and in 1922, Arnold founded the[world's] first slalom ski races. Mabel and a group of British Women established theLadies' Ski Clubhere as well.\"\nArnold's arrival also paved the way for the formation of theKandahar Ski Clubin 1924 and the inauguration of the country's first ski school in Mürren in 1930.A year later, the firstAlpine World Ski Championshipskicked off in this tiny town in February 1931.\nNearly a century later, the surrounding mountains are laced with 54km of fresh, powdery pistes connected through cable cars, funiculars and chairlifts. When snow conditions allow, you can ski 16km from the Schilthorn summit to the valley floor in Lauterbrunnen.\n\"A coffee at the peak and a trip down on skis with family and friends is how I love spending my winter days in Mürren,\" said Alan Ramsay, a sociable Scot who has called the village home for more than 25 years and helps organise theInternational Inferno, the world's biggest amateur ski race held in the town annually (21-24 January 2026).\nBut locals say there's more to Mürren than just skiing. From June through September, the area becomes a popular paragliding destination, offering magnificent birds-eye views over the region's soaring crags, turquoise lakes and more than 70 cascadingwaterfalls.You can also stroll the flower-studdedtrailsand meadows dotted with grazing sheep.\n\"The mountains are an ever-changing canvas,\" said Belinda Bühler, an avid trail runner who has lived her whole life in Mürren. \"In the winter, they wear a beautiful white coat. In the summer, the mood changes depending on whether we are having hot, rainy or foggy days. However, as winter slowly departs, you can already smell the scent of spring. As the earth starts to warm up, you see early summer blossoms and soon there are flower-filled meadows.\"\nBühler's main advice for those coming outside of ski season? \"Get out into nature onto the trails. You don't have to walk too far but as soon as you're on a trail, you're alone and can savour the stillness and beauty most palpably. The air is so pure and clean. I have grown up in Murren but I always call myself a local tourist, as I still tend to stop and take photos during my hikes. What I feel, see and hear on the trails in Mürren is indescribable!\"\nBernard's wife, Julia Lunn, who leads families and women on hikes in Murren added, \"People don't come here to shop or sightsee, but to experience life through skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, or simple pleasures like taking in the unrivalled views in solitude and dipping into the streams or the unspoiledGrauseelilake.\"\nAt Ramsay's advice, I decided to experience one of those simple pleasures for myself. After grabbing a wooden sledge from the localIntersportrental shop, I took the funicular up to the Allmendhubel mountain station (the starting point of the infamous 3kmBob Chasefeatured in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service). After a few quick practice runs, I whisked down the soft, powdery slopes of the Blumental Valley, peppered with pines and chalet-like holiday homes with a sense of wonder and a child-like grin plastered across my face.\n\"When growing up in Mürren as a child, I didn't realise how lucky I was because I took [this] all for granted,\" said Bühler. \"As a teenager, I even found the village too small and limiting. However, after I travelled around a bit and returned to Murren, I fell in love with it all over again, especially with the sense of freedom it gave me. Today, I often feel speechless when I wake up here and find it hard to describe Mürren, because no words seem to do its beauty justice. It is a place that needs to be experienced and felt.\"\nEven after just a two-day visit, I think I know what she means.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

It says the increase in the minimum wage will also have an impact.\n\"In the last seven years we've seen a 50% increase in staff costs and energy bills are double what they were in 2020-21,\" said managing director Drew Mullin.\n\"We've got no positives at the moment. We are also uncertain about business rates. We are aware they will change and based on what's happened with National Insurance contributions we expect them to go up.\"\nMr Waters from Visit East of England described the NI rise as \"the perfect example of the law of unintended consequences. Rather than boost the economy, [the Chancellor] has done the opposite\".\n\"We've got tens of thousands of SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] which could be family-run businesses , husband and wife teams... entrepreneurs all wanting to get on, who are being stifled by this budget,\" he said.\nThe government has argued that increasing the tax for employers rather than workers is fair and will fund improvements to public services.\nIt also said that staff would benefit from the rise in the minimum wage.\nBBC Politics East is broadcast at 10:00 on Sundays, and isavailable on the BBC iPlayer.\nFollow East of England news onX,Instagramand Facebook:BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks,BBC Cambridgeshire,BBC Essex,BBC Norfolk,BBC NorthamptonshireorBBC Suffolk.\n"

Snowdrifts huddle at the road's verges and on it goes persistently, almost gasping for air, past lonely farms beneath besieging summits.\nThere are many superlative road trips to take in North America, but if you find yourself on US Route 24, driving through Lake County in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, know you are on an old road to somewhere extraordinary.\nAmong the places on this storied route isLeadville, with a reputation often chalked up to its elevation. At 3,109m (10,200ft), it's the highest incorporated city in North America. But while the town is always in danger of being dwarfed by the surrounding landscape, the setting also reveals much mythology about Colorado's most lionised subjects: the gold rush and the Wild West.\n\"So many people, Americans included, are so unfamiliar with our story,\" said Katie Hild, manager of Leadville's Tourism and Visitor Center, housed today in the original red sandstone American National Bank building. \"This is a town that's been shaped by bust and boom – so much has happened here.\"\nThe triumph of Leadville, as Hild puts it, is its many strata. The first mineral deposits were found in the area's California Gulch in 1860, and, within a year, around 10,000 prospectors had flooded the high plain, with more than $3m in ore extracted. By 1880, Leadville was served by three railroads, and between 1878 and 1884 the town had freighted 54 million ounces of silver. Soon, rich seams of zinc, iron, gold and lead were being quarried.\n\"Mining is our root and some of the largest pockets of precious ores on the continent have been found here,\" added Hild. \"At its peak, there were 30,000 people in Leadville, but by 1893 silver prices had plummeted and the glory days were over nearly as quickly as they'd begun.\"\nExploring Leadville nowadays is a kind of treasure hunt – and much of this deep history can be absorbed in the Mining District outside town in the foothills below Mount Sherman. TheRoute of the Silver Kings, once the backdrop for one of the richest mining camps in the US, reveals 14 original structures and 20 sites from the era that visitors can explore on a signposted gravel road. Incredibly, the US Bureau of Mines estimates there are 1,329 shafts, 1,628 prospect holes and more than 200 miles of workings, all hidden beneath the surface.\nFor many, the 21-mile circuit represents more than just a charmingly loose collection of mineshafts. Rather, the ghost towns and, most dramatically of all, the buckled headframes and mining camp hoists have come to embody an idealisation of the American dream. It is telling that the names of the camps are Silver Spoon, Diamond Dolly, Upper Oro and Hopemore. But those with a silver gleam in their eyes are advised against any Indiana Jones type antics: all treasure hunting and metal detecting is strictly forbidden.\nLeadville's name evokes tin-hatted miners picking through ore, but the town turns out to be equally infused with the spirit of a Wild West film set. There are around a dozen beautiful buildings that sag characterfully, bringing to mind the rootin' tootin' cowboy country of Buffalo Bill and Doc Holliday, both of whom visited during their late-19th-Century heyday. Walk south down Harrison Avenue from theNational Mining Hall of Fame and Museumand on the left is theDelaware Hotel, once a premier lodging for mining magnates. A few blocks away, you see theTabor Opera House, constructed by silver baron Horace Tabor in 1879, and where miners and madams once mingled.\nLocals might tell you Oscar Wilde once performed there, while such was the fiscal boom that an additional door was built to get circus elephants into the opera house. One night, illusionist Harry Houdini is also said to have disappeared through the stage's trap door. It's easy to understand how he must have felt. Entering Leadville today feels like slipping through a portal into another time.\nPerhaps the most engrossing example of the street's preserved architecture is a timber-clad landmark across the road: theSilver Dollar Saloon, where tipplers can still order a whiskey under the diamond dust mirrors at the original wooden bar from 1879.\n\"You couldn't label Leadville as the capital of the Old Wild West, especially when weighed against other legendary towns like Dodge City or Tombstone, but it certainly played a pivotal role during the transformative gold and silver rush eras,\" said Adam Ducharme, Lake County's tourism and economic development director. \"Walk into the Silver Dollar Saloon and you're not just stepping into a bar – it's an immersion into a living relic of this time.\"\nBut wherever you go in Colorado in winter these days, the subject everyone is obsessed with is not silver dollars, but snowfall — and 11 miles farther along US Route 24, the next chapter in Leadville's untold history is slowly revealed.\nSki Cooperisn't Colorado's most celebrated mountain resort, but where it beats others in the state is it retains the authenticity of a mountain as it used to be. Non-profit and municipality owned, it looks out to Mount Elbert, the state's highest mountain at 4,399m (14,433ft). More than that, the landscape has the emptiness that purists seek away from the surrounding busier towns.\n\"Cooper is not a resort, but a place to come skiing,\" said head of operations Patrick Torsell. \"We only have three lifts – nothing compared to the mega-resorts – but Leadville locals have a strong relationship with us and our history. It's a peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches in the parking lot kind of place.\"\nMore like this:\n•The US' awe-inspiring 'Highway to the Sky'\n•A 210km drive through 'the most beautiful place on Earth'\n•An epic road trip over and under the Atlantic Ocean\nLikewise, this is a mountain that covers its tracks well. For this is whereColorado's ski culturebegan.\nThe story starts with the first mountain unit in US military history, the 10th Mountain Division of World War Two. In summer 1941, its soldiers received extensive training in winter warfare on Cooper Hill, constructing what was then the world's longest draglift. Then, in the winter of 1944-1945, three of its regiments marshalled a series of surprise attacks during a surprise offensive in Italy's Apennine Mountains. It's a melancholy tale: around 1,000 soldiers were killed and 4,000 injured. And yet, their actions were instrumental in Germany's later surrender.\nWhat many don't know is following their return to the Rockies, the 10th's veteransshaped the American ski industry. More than 66 ski resorts were managed or founded by former military personnel, including Aspen, Vail and Arapahoe Basin – and this taps into a broader strain of patriotism among locals today.\nAtArapahoe Basin, during the 1953-1954 season, for instance, the unit installed the firstPoma liftin the US. Then, in 1957 atWinter Park, they constructed two draglifts said to be the fastest in the world. The division'sbackcountry cabins, once used for deep-snow combat training, are now open to visitors to book year-round.\nBut that's not all. Six miles from Leadville in the Pando Valley, the 10th Mountain Division trained atCamp Hale. Sitting between sheer-sided rocky spurs and snow-daubed mountains with the Eagle River winding nearby, it was once a sprawling encampment of 14,000 soldiers, 226 barracks, 100 mess halls, three theatres, a chapel, horse and mule barns and a hospital. Little remains nowadays, but a 10-stop self-guided tour of relics snakes past ammunition bunkers, a guard shack and a field house. To be so rapidly transplanted from pistes to pistols fires the imagination.\nThe best story at Camp Hale concerns the CIA, which took over the base in the 1950s to train secretive special ops teams. At one time, 170 Tibetans were drafted in for secret operations against the Communist government in China. The unexpected coda is locals were told it was a test site for bombs. Nowadays, with snowshoe, hiking, biking and horse-riding trails, it is a less-assuming and simpler world away from the currents of history.\nIn few places in Colorado are the ghosts of the past so alive as on US Route 24. Leadville, this Wild West city in the clouds, is faithful to this picture. It then comes as a bit of a shock to head out on the road out of town, to leave the Old West and silver-rush-era mines behind in the rearview, to return to the 21st-Century of haulage trucks, roadside fast food stops and gas stations framed by the Rockies, in all their glory.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem.

The dark drama satirises the excesses of the rich, set against the struggles of the staff, in a glamorous setting.\nIt's thrilling, pacey stuff with beautiful people, gripping action and a tense setup that tells you from episode one, that although this looks like paradise, something terrible is going to happen. In the first season, a coffin is unloaded from a plane; while in the second, a body is discovered floating in the sea by a guest. Season three'straileris peppered with shots of guns and whispers of body bags amid the palm trees and luxury spa treatments.\nDespite the gory details and the lampooning of the rich, everyone wants to stay at the White Lotus. When it was announced mid 2024 thatThailand would be the location for the TV show's third season, global interest in travel to the country soared, with booking platforms reporting immediate increases in searches, and airlines includingFinnairadding extra weekly flights to Phuket. Hotels.com reported a40% spikein booking interest for theFour Seasons Resort Koh Samui, one of the filming locations.\nThe expectations come with a precedent: the Sicilian hotel, theFour Seasons San Domenico Palacein Taormina, Sicily, where season two was filmed, reported it was booked out for six months when it reopened after filming and continues to attract guests wanting a slice of the White Lotus lifestyle. The original White Lotus, theFour Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, Hawaii, said it saw a 425% uptick year on year in website visits and 386% increase in availability checks.\nThe White Lotus isn't the first drama to have an outsized effect on the travel industry – the impact of films like Lord of the Rings and The Sound of Music on tourism has been well documented, as has themuch-criticisedEmily in Paris. But what's interesting right now, in the digital age, is how quickly news about a streamed TV show setting can have an impact.\n\"Back in 2015, research showed that around one in five people coming to Britain were coming because of something they'd seen on TV,\" said screen tourism specialist Seren Welch. \"Fast forward to now, and the latest Visit Britain research shows that nine in 10 visitors to the UK are influenced by what they have seen in film and TV. It's unheard of.\"\nThis rise is down to the prevalence of streaming platforms: as Welch notes, 10 years ago, we didn't have Disney+ and Netflix was a lesser phenomenon. Today, streaming algorithms are powerful drivers of our behaviour far beyond the screen, with the opportunity to binge-watch everything anywhere leading viewers to be ever more immersed.\n\"I've heard a British Airways exec say that when they see a spike in traffic to a destination, they look at what's peaking on Netflix to explain it,\" Welch said.\nWhen it comes to planning a location for a TV show like The White Lotus, Mark Kamine knows a thing or two. Kamine, one of The White Lotus's executive producers, started his career as a location scout working on all six seasons of The Sopranos, along with film credits on Hollywood films including Ted, American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook.\nHis new bookOn Locations: Lessons Learned From my Life on Set with the Sopranos and in the Film Industrydetails the behind-the-scenes wrangling inherent in location work, from negotiating with strip club owners keen to do under-the-table deals, to pacifying home owners who have just found out you've staged a mafia killing in their house. It's a lively read, running through the behind-the-scenes production level details about how to make one destination stand in for another on the tightest of tight budgets.\nWhile many of Kamine's previous film and TV productions have had financial issues constraining filming locations, when it came to The White Lotus, the wild success of the first seasons meant that when deciding the location for season three, there was plenty of choice.\n\"Mike White had the idea for something around Eastern philosophy,\" Kamine explained. \"We were looking for what was practical and eye-catching, and to start with, Korea, Philippines, Japan, Bali and Sri Lanka were in the mix, as well as Thailand.\"\nFurther discussion and research narrowed the choice to Japan and Thailand, with White and Kamine and others making research trips to see what would work best. (White typically stays in the resort to write and research the show ahead of production.)\nKamine notes in his book that the key challenges faced by location scouts centre on budgets: productions often end up being shot in dupe locations, where, for example, Prague might stand in for New Jersey, because even when subsidised, US locations can't compete with European, Asian or African crew and material costs. But for a sure-fire hit like The White Lotus, which had areported $38.5m budget for season twoand drew in 4.1 million US viewers for its finale, Karmine and his team chose the option that reflected the story they wanted to tell best, rather than make a financial compromise.\n\"Mike said that he feels like we've cracked the code,\" Kamine admitted, \"in that we've figured out how to stay in these luxury locations and create great TV. What a life.\"\nThe new series is filmed in theFour Seasons Resort Koh Samui, with theMandarin Oriental Bangkok,Anantara Mai Khao Phuket VillasandAnantara Bophut Koh Samui Resortalso featured – along with a little creative licence.\n\"Anyone who has been to the Four Seasons in Sicily that we used in the show will know that the beach isn't where it seems to be,\" said Kamine. \"Some scenes in season three are shot at one hotel, and some aspects are filmed elsewhere. The common spaces need to have real impact, that's a driver here. Overall, the main thing is that it looks beautiful.\"\nThe White Lotus team are aware of the impact the filming has on future bookings and the local tourism scene. Kamine says he keeps in touch with the hotel managers from the previous series and is aware of the debate around overtourism, noting that these popular five-star locations already have existing tourism infrastructure and have been developed to handle a certain number of visitors.\nMore like this:\n•White Lotus 3 Thailand filming locations revealed\n•The White Lotus season three review\n•'Set-jetting': How on-screen locations are becoming travel destinations\nHowever, given that films shot in Thailand have driven a surge of tourism in the past –the extreme popularity of The Beach caused Maya Bay to close, for instance – it's somewhat surprising to find that Thailand has no plan in place to mitigate a potential tourism surge from the show. A spokesperson from Tourism Thailand noted that the country is still trying to build back its tourism industry following Covid, and that since the show airs in Thailand's shoulder season, it is most likely to boost tourism numbers in these quieter months when there is more capacity than in peak season.\nThe White Lotus isn't the only streaming show boosting holiday bookings. Asset-jettingcontinues to be a popular motif in the travel industry, new series including Yellowstone prequel 1923, set in Montana, are expected to drive more tourism. It's not without its problems: in 2023,The Washington Postreported that Yellowstone has driven tourism to the region but has brought with it misconceptions: it does rain, it can be cold, and not everyone is as well dressed as the show would have you believe. That's showbusiness.\nSeason two of Wednesday,also releasing this year, is a good case in point: the show is set in a fictional town in Vermont but season one was shot in Romania and season two filmed in Ireland. The final season of Stranger Things will air later this year as well, set in the town of Hawkins, Indiana but filmed inJackson, Georgia. It's a known filming location – The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries were also shot there – and the localtourism authorityalready has information on how to follow the shows around town. Tellingly, it notes that \"the upside down is NOT included\".\nAs for The White Lotus, now that season three is out, thoughts are turning to season four. Kamine wouldn't confirm or deny any location currently under discussion for the next series but did let slip that one thing is important: going back perhaps to his Soprano days, it needs to be somewhere where it's easy to dump a body.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise.

Here are his favourite spots to unearth Rome's millennia of secrets, from the Vatican Museums to Ostia Antica.\nFrom the 1st-Century BCE ruins of the Imperial Forum to the Trevi Fountain’s Baroque splendour, Rome packs such an overwhelming myriad of postcard-worthy landmarks that digging through its historical layers can make any visitor feel like they've turned into an archaeologist.\nAlberto Angela, a TV presenter, global ambassador for Italian heritage, art, history and culture, and a familiar face in Italian living rooms for nearly four decades knows a thing or two about his hometown's 2,000 years of history – and he's ready to help visitors discover it, especially as this year'sJubileenewly puts it into the limelight.\n\"Rome has two faces,\" says Angela. \"The Papal – that of the rich – and its working-class soul, the one that is closest to us… the most interesting,\" he says.\nIn a city where grand basilicas lie next to shady alleyways, Angela recommends exploring without cramming in too many sights – so that one can \"immerse oneself in the world of the ancients\".\nHaving followed in the footsteps of his famous father, Piero Angela – Italy's most well-known documentarist often called a \"national treasure\" – the younger Angela attributes his career and love of history to growing up in the Italian capital.\n\"You breathe history here,\" he says. \"Anyone who comes to Rome can see the same afterglow Caesar would have seen. You aren't in a place that doesn't exist anymore. Rome was rebuilt on top of its ancient structures.\"\nFor Angela, this is what makes Rome so unique. \"The city did not cancel its history, unlike many others,\" he says. \"Living here, you understand the ancients.\"\nEmerging from a small market settlement on the Tiber, the city of Rome was at an intersection between the Mediterranean and mainland Europe, making it a crossroads that swelled into the world’s first true metropolis. Angela believes that the city's immense global-reaching political and symbolic impact throughout history means everyone has a \"piece\" of Rome inside them – which is why it can have such a profound impact on those who visit it.\nHere are Angela's favourite ways to experience ancient history in modern Rome.\nMuch of central Rome's labyrinthine urban grid is a direct heir of the former imperial capital, with public spaces like the Baroque Piazza Navona or Campo de’ Fiori piazza taking their shape from a bygone stadium and theatre, respectively.\nBut on thePalatine Hill, the mythical birthplace of Rome, you can actually walk on the same stones where emperors Augustus and Nero once dwelled.\n\"It's the place where the Caesars lived and died,\" Angela says.\nAs the legend goes, twin brothers Romulus and Remus received an omen from the gods and decided to lay the foundations of a new city on the Palatine Hill in 753 BCE. In the subsequent centuries, the Palatine developed into an exclusive neighbourhood of patrician villas and Imperial palaces – indeed, it’s where the word “palace” takes its root.\nOne of the legendary seven hills of the ancient city, offering an incomparable vantage point with a 360 panorama, Palatine Hill offers what Angela describes as \"a beautiful walk\", with arguably the best views of the Colosseum – the unmistakable \"star of ancient Rome\".\nVisiting the Palatine is a full immersion into the life of the Roman empire, with a plethora of impressive ruins, including the mosaic floors of Augustus's palace, Domitian's hippodrome and the balcony overlooking the Circus Maximus racecourse.\nWebsite:https://colosseo.it/en/area/the-palatine/\nAddress: Parco archeologico del Colosseo, Via di S. Gregorio 30, 00186\nPhone: + 39 06 21115 843\nInstagram: @parcocolosseo\nAs the centre of Catholicism and one of the most important sites in Christendom, the Unesco-listed Vatican is firmly entrenched among Rome's unmissable sights. In honour of the 2025 Jubilee, tourists and pilgrims alike are flocking toSaint Peter's Basilicato walk through its Holy Door, opened for the occasion every quarter of a century.\nBut while much of the Holy See's architectural majesty is immediately apparent – from the Michelangelo- and Giacomo della Porta-designed designed dome of Saint Peter's all the way to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums – some of its greatest treasures are hidden underground.\n\"Once in Saint Peter's, you walk on beautiful marble floorings, you look up to the Baldachin,\" says Angela, renowned for his 2015 TV miniseries Alla Scoperta dei Musei Vaticani (Discovering the Vatican Museums). \"But you can go underground. The Popes' tombs can be found underneath, but under those is the ancient Roman graveyard where Peter the Apostle himself was buried. The foundations of [the Basilica] are a graveyard.\"\nThe Vatican Necropolis, excavated only in the 1940s, features mausoleums belonging to citizens of many faiths, as well as a cluster of tombs called \"Field P”, suspected by some scholars to hold the burial chamber of the Church founder himself.\n\"It's a trip into ancient Rome that you wouldn't expect to find [there]\", Angela says. \"It makes you understand how Rome really is.\"\nVisitors must book visits to the Necropolis on the official website of Saint Peter’s Basilica. The dress code mandates covered shoulders and below-the-knee clothing.\nWebsite:https://www.basilicasanpietro.va/en/san-pietro/the-necropolis\nAddress: Piazza San Pietro, 00120 Città del Vaticano, Vatican City\nPhone: +39 06 6988 5318\nInstagram: @basilicasanpietro.va\nRome has more than 900 Catholic sites of worship built over the course of the centuries. Now and then, there's one that best encapsulates the city's multi-millennial history, like Angela's pick, theBasilica of San Clemente.\n\"This Basilica conceals the three souls of Rome – Baroque, medieval and ancient,\" Angela says. \"Anyone who comes across it is enchanted.\"\nTucked behind the Colosseum and a composite of two different churches, San Clemente – dedicated to the third pope of the same name – has been a site of worship since ancient Roman times, when it served as a temple for the Zoroastrian cult of Mithras.\nThe temple eventually swelled into its grand current form, featuring an intricate overlay of architectural styles – from its Renaissance courtyard and the Mannerist facade of the main Basilica, all the way to its underground, early medieval second structure, which hides ancient Roman remnants.\n\"The exterior is beautiful and well-maintained, from the 16th Century, with a Cosmatesque [geometric] marble flooring, and then you take the stairs and arrive at the medieval Basilica,\" says Angela. \"And you find yourself right in ancient Rome, in a Roman temple.\"\nWebsite:https://www.basilicasanclemente.com/eng/\nAddress: Piazza di S. Clemente, 00184\nPhone: +39 06 774 0021\nInstagram: @sanclementeroma\nFrom 17th-CenturyVilla Borgheseto theCapitoline, the city’s oldest art gallery, Rome has no shortage of museums displaying a vast array of artefacts – matched by equally colossal crowds of spectators.\nWhile Angela certainly recommends visitors enjoy the time-worn classics, he also suggests a quieter, quirkier alternative:the Museo della Comunicazione Scritta dei Romani.\nConveniently located a mere five-minute walk from the Termini train station, the museum is found inside the Baths of Diocletian, where the majestic 4th-Century Imperialtermaehave survived in remarkable condition. It is also home to a curious collection of esoteric Roman artefacts, showing how the ancients dabbled in the occult.\n\"It's a museum dedicated to how Romans expressed themselves,\" Angela says. \"But there's a part dedicated to magic, voodoo of sorts.\"\nSuperstition was the unspoken crux of ancient Roman life, but one that we often overlook. \"It's a world that often gets left behind, that of spiritual beliefs,\" he adds. \"They found the objects in a parking lot.\"\nAmong the objects on display is a large copper cauldron, curse tablets (defixiones), ritual tools and even Christian spells.\n\"For someone coming from the station, especially if it rains, it's quite an intriguing thing to visit,\" says Angela.\nWebsite:https://museonazionaleromano.beniculturali.it/terme-di-diocleziano/il-museo-della-comunicazione-scritta-dei-romani/\nAddress: Viale Enrico de Nicola 78, 00185\nPhone: +39 06 684 851\nInstagram: @museonazionaleromano\nThe 16th to 18th Centuries were a crucial time for Rome's urban development, as the city's aristocratic families – including the Farnese, Borghese, Doria and Pamphilj – vied for social dominance through commissioning lavish building projects, all designed in the Baroque style favoured by the Papal Counter-Reformation.\n\"I'd advise anyone coming to visit Rome to see the palaces of the powerful Roman families,\" says Angela.\nWhile listing a few examples – Palazzo Colonna and Palazzo Farnese among them – few rival the opulence of thePalazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome's very own \"Versailles\", in Angela's words.\nThe product of an alliance of noble families, what resulted was a Baroque fantasy come to life and an impressive art collection featuring the works of many of Italy's greats, from Titian to Raphael.\nIts crown jewel is its Hall of Mirrors, commissioned by Gabriele Valvassori in the 1730s and featuring whimsical frescos, gilded Venetian frescos and ornate gold-plated furniture.\n\"I had never been prior to shooting [a TV special] and it's truly spectacular,\" he says. \"It truly surpasses anything else.\"\nWebsite:https://www.doriapamphilj.it/roma/\nAddress: Via del Corso 305, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 679 7323\nInstagram: @galleriadoriapamphilj\nMany visitors coming to Rome don't know that the city has what Angela considers its very own \"Pompeii\" around 32km from the city centre: Ostia Antica.\nOnce Rome's sea port, potentially from as early as the 7th Century BCE, Ostia Antica developed into a bustling seaside suburb, reaching a peak of 75,000 inhabitants in the late Imperial age. While the city declined after the empire’s fall, and the coastline ended up advancing by 3.2km, much of the ancient town that once stood there has been preserved.\n\"You lose yourself there, you can see everything,\" Angela says. \"Bakeries, public bathrooms (latrines), homes, apartment blocks… street businesses, not too dissimilar to those of today.\"\nA tour of Ostia Antica can show you much of the amenities and features of ancient Roman life – from its 1st-Century BCE theatre, to its forum, public baths and necropolis.\nFor Angela, Ostia Antica best preserves the \"popolare\" (working-class) soul of ancient Rome – one which its newer counterpart, the beach suburb Lido di Ostia, has carried on in modern form.\nOstia Antica is a roughly 30-minute drive from central Rome, and can be reached in around the same time by taking the Metromare commuter rail from the Porta S Paolo station.\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads.\nI checked into theMakathanee Resortnext to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea.\nAs I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand.\nPromoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) asthe country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours ­– party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south – Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earnedinternationalrecognitionfor sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future.\nWhile many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism.\n\"It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,\" Sudhidhanakul said. \"But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor – those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.\"\nIn 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers.\n\"We never worried about overtourism,\" said Sudhidhankul, \"as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.\"\nThis ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like theKoh Mak Coral Conservation Groupoffer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated byTrash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, \"Every week we clean, we educate, we change\". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.\nMore like this:\n•Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n•Here's where Asia's best female chef goes for pad Thai in Bangkok\n•Thailand's cooling rice dish to beat the heat\nI spent the next few days earnestly practising slow-life activities: reading in a hammock, snoozing in a deck chair, swimming and taking long walks along the beach looking for shells. Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes – plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga.\nI took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined atie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort.\nOne day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of theKoh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. \"When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,\" she said. \"I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.\"\nKoh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub,Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. \"We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy.\" Sudhidhanakul told me.\nYet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm – cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness – it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand.\nIt is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "Canada's remote (but accessible) dark-sky sanctuary",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "Spanning 11,000 sq km of protected, pristine wilderness, Jasper National Park offers a one-of-a-kind destination for stargazers.\nIt's a balmy October evening and an overture from the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra Strings hushes a buzzing crowd. Dusk has fallen inJasper National Park, and I'm snug under a blanket, gazing up at a sea of stars amidst the Milky Way's glow. Just below, snow-dusted peaks rise towards the heavens and the clear, glacial-blue waters of Lac Beauvert blend into the inky darkness.\nSymphony Under the Starsis one of many events at the annualDark Sky Festival(17 October to 2 November 2025) held in Jasper National Park, one of the world's largest and most accessible dark sky preserves.\nDesignated as aDark Sky Preservein 2011 by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) and spanning 11,000 sq km of protected land where minimal to no light pollution is allowed, Jasper isn't just one of the best places to stargaze; it's also an ideal spot to see the Northern Lights. And as experts predict that 2025 \"will mesmerise\" with one of the greatest aurora displays in 20 years, there's never been a better time to explore this quiet corner of the Canadian Rockies.\nUnlike other Dark Sky Preserves in Canada and the US that have little to no infrastructure or lodging, the eponymous 4,700-person town of Jasper – located within the preserve – allows travellers easy stargazing access. According to Tyler Burgardt, an astrophysicist and general manager of theJasper Planetarium, what makes Jasper so unique is visitors can drive right in. Located roughly 3.5 hours from Edmonton and Calgary, the town's hotels and locally led stargazing tours means star-lovers don't need to rough it.\n\"You get to see something you don't get in other [accessible] places, which is the ability to see thousands of stars, even from the middle of town,\" Burgardt said.\nHisfavourite touris one offered in summer, where guests visit the planetarium and then take a twilight stroll down to a peninsula located onLac Beauvert. Ringed by rugged peaks and hauntingly silent, the only sound you may hear is the soft ripple of wind on the water. Burgardt estimates the Northern Lights are visible here roughly every 10 days to two weeks. \"It's just absolutely beautiful,\" he said. \"It's a really cool way to truly experience the nighttime side of the Canadian Rockies.\"\nThe quaint, alpine community is committed to ensuring that minimal artificial lighting is visible by installing streetlights that point downwards and have a softer glow than regular lights. As Burgardt notes, Jasper's location within the national park, and surrounded by theUnesco-designated Canadian Rocky Mountains, also provides a natural barrier from the artificial light created by nearby cities.\nAccording to the RASC, the goal of a dark sky designation in a community is to promote \"low-impact lighting practices, to improve the nocturnal environment for plants and wildlife, to protect and expand dark observing sites for astronomy and to provide accessible locations for naturalists and the general public to experience the naturally dark night sky\".\nPhillipa Gunn, public relations and communications officer for Parks Canada, said Jasper National Park initially met some of therequirements from the RASCneeded to become a Dark Sky Preserve prior to its official designation, including accessible observation sites where visitors can view the sky.\n\"Jasper National Park is an ideal location for a Dark Sky Preserve as 97% of the park is a designated wilderness area, free of light pollution,\" Gunn said. Parks Canada has also continued to expand itsdark sky interpretation programmes, while working with the town and private partners to ensure all the street fixtures in the townsite are dark-sky compliant. As a result, when driving to Jasper at night, it's nearly impossible to tell a town is even located in the vast blackness that envelopes the area.\nIn July 2024, a series of devastating fires ripped through Jasper, causing the \"jewel of the Rockies\" to close for several months. The park reopened last autumn in time for the Jasper Dark Sky Festival – albeit just on a smaller scale. But with 2025 marking the festival's 15th anniversary, Naji Khouri, director of destination development for Tourism Jasper, says this year's festival will be bigger than ever before. Plans include a drone show where 200 synchronised drones put on a light display, notable guest speakers (Bill Nye has previously attended), planetarium stargazing sessions and a portable telescope and tent at the base of theJasper Sky Tram.\n\"We invite space or science enthusiasts, aurora chasers and anyone that is fascinated by the dark sky and wants to learn more about it. We have unique experiences that are really of interest to a wide range of people, including families,\" said Khouri. And locals want people to know that Jasper isn't only open for the Dark Sky Festival, but for business as usual, with more than 80% of local businesses back open since the blaze.\nAfter hiking theSulphur Skylinetrail to experience sweeping views of theFiddle River Valleyand Utopia Mountain, paddling on the \"pearl necklace\" that is Maligne Lake or exploring thePyramid Lake Overlookby day, visitors should also seek out stories of the stars from an Indigenous and cultural lens.\nThe Indigenous people of Canada havelong utilised the night skyin all aspects of daily life: the stars and constellations served as guiding lights for their ancestors and the sky was used as both a clock and calendar, indicating when to plant, hunt and work the land. The stars are also intrinsically linked to First Nations' spiritual identities and are connected to the legends of the past.\nMatricia Bauer ofWarrior Women, an Indigenous- and women-owned business run by Bauer and her daughter, offers afireside stargazing tourin Jasper that is based around Indigenous creation stories. Being of Cree descent, Bauer recognised the importance of decolonising her own education and that included learning about the Cree Star Chart and the Indigenous constellations that came to rest in thekisik(sky), in Cree.\n\"[The Cree Star Chart] made sense of the world around me, it made sense of the Northern Lights,\" she said. \"I understood who Star Woman was. I understood why we come from the stars and why we return to the stars.\"\nIn Cree culture, there are different Star Beings, and Star Woman is one of them. According to Bauer, Star Woman saw the Earth – where humans lived – and she gave up her Star Being to come to \"Turtle Island\" (North America) . When she became pregnant with twins, this was the start of the First People. At the end of her life, she was granted three wishes and one of the wishes was that she could return to the sky.\nMore like this:\n•The Indigenous tribes reclaiming travel\n•The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n•The last places on Earth to see truly dark starry nights\n\"And so, when we see the Northern Lights, we call that theCipayuk,\" said Bauer. \"It means ancestors dancing, or ghosts dancing. It's reminding us that there is another realm that exists, that we get to stay in for the rest of our lives. It's when we go back to the Star World where we came from.\"\nAs Bauer recants stories with songs, she also tells me about Spider Woman, the one who is weaving our fates in the dark sky that soars above us. She then recounts the story of the coyote, tricking the wolves and bears into the sky so that he could create his own constellation. A story that takes place in winter, to be told in winter, when the days are short, the nights are long and the fire becomes a place to gather.\nTo Bauer and many First Nations residents in and around Jasper, the stars, also known asachakosak, are considered relatives: \"Every constellation, every star has a beautiful song, has a beautiful story, has a beautiful place in our culture.\"\nThere are many more stories that Bauer wants to tell for visitors, and many more conversations to still be had under the black cloak of Jasper's night sky. The snap, crackle and pop of the fire is an accompanying beat to the drum that she plays, and her voice dances towards the place where she knows she will one day return.\n--\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly noted that Wood Buffalo National Park and Grasslands National Park don't have lodging available for travellers.

But the following day, the occupants – mostly businessmen who had worked late - would rise up and head back to the office, grateful for this efficient sleep solution that had saved them a commute home in the early hours.\nAs the concept spread, tourists happy to sleep in a room no bigger than its bed began to bunk up alongside them, eager to sample this unusual aspect of Japanese culture. Fast-forward to today, and high hotel room rates, fuelled byyears of rising real estate prices, have supercharged this typically low-cost concept, which offers budget travellers priced out of traditional hotels more privacy than a hostel dormitory and more comfort and connectivity than camping. The capsules, which are predominantly single-occupancy, also answer the currentboom in solo travel, with single-sex capsule hotels providing additional security.\nWith the global capsule hotel marketprojectedto reach $327m by 2031, curious hybrids have emerged to sustain the trend and attract new customers. They're tempting the TikTok generation with increasingly outlandish forms, fromupcycled sewer pipesin the Colombian desert tospace-age podswith a dashboard of ambient controls in downtown Sydney, Australia – all promising a unique experience and shareable stories for social media. Meanwhilecapsule-cum-bookstoresinvite book lovers to snooze among the shelves, and boutique versions bring luxury to a traditionally no-frills market withfancy decoror promises offluffy duck-feather duvets.\nAs the concept continues to reinvent itself, here are eight of the most extraordinary examples.\nNine Hours, a chain of 13 hotels across Japan, from Fukuoka in the west to the north-east island of Hokkaido, has an unusual by-product: sleep data. In theShinagawa Station(men only) andAkasakabranches, guests can sign up for a \"9h sleep fitscan\" service, where sensors detect everything from breathing to facial expressions to generate a sleep report that tracks their heart rate, identifies sleep apnea and even monitors snoring. In a sector where a novel or low-budget stay is often prioritised over comfort, Nine Hours' interest in how well its guests are sleeping sets it apart.\nAcross the franchise, the white, minimalist decor continues this clinical theme, while its rows of sleek, shiny sleeping pods would not look out of place on the set of a science-fiction movie. The name refers to the hotel's cost-cuttingconceptthat reduces room rental to the essential nine hours, allowing seven hours for sleep and an hour on either side for washing and dressing. Just need a nap? Hourly rates are also available.\nA night in a transparent sleeping pod clinging to a cliff face above Peru's Sacred Valley is not everyone's idea of a relaxing stay, but for adrenaline-lovers, it's hard to beat – not least for the incredible 300-degree views of the surrounding mountains and the formidable condors that inhabit them.\nA near-vertical climb of 400m is the only way to reach theSkylodge Adventure Suites, but climbing experience is not necessary – only good health and a head for heights – and descending is speedier thanks to a series of zip wires. Each capsule includes a private bathroom ensuring that night trips to the toilet are not life-threatening, and when the sun rises, you can enjoy a cup of tea on your private deck. Looking for a little more luxury? A little further down the Urubamba river, sister site,Starlodge, adds hillside hot tubs to the capsule hotel experience.\nTheTubo Hotel, La Tatacoais just a 10-minute drive fromColombia's second-largest desert, the eponymous Tatacoa, famous for its clear starry skies. When you've taken in the giant cacti and curious rock formations of the Tatacoa's cinnamon-coloured sands, this rainbow of tiny, air-conditioned rooms with a shared swimming pool offers a welcome oasis. The 37 capsules are fashioned from concrete sewer pipes painted in candy colours, providing just enough room for a double bed. Almost half of the rooms have a shared bathroom, but the room rate is a snip and you've a shady garden, bar and restaurant on your doorstep. \"This innovative and colourful place offers you a unique experience,\" says Ambar Quintana, the hotel's administrator. \"It has everything you need to rest in a natural environment of fresh air and vegetation.\"\nSuspended among the conifers like oversized Christmas baubles, theFree Spirit Sphereson Vancouver Island, Canada, feel \"like you are floating in the canopy among the sleeping birds\", according to owner Tom Chudleigh. The first sphere was introduced 25 years ago, driven by a desire to promote ecotourism and preserve Canada's ancient forests.\nMore like this:\n•The UK's five most beautiful national parks\n•The best travel photographs from around the globe\n•The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\nThere are currently three spheres, each based on the principle ofbiomimicryand shaped with a giant seed pod or nutshell in mind: light but with a strong shell. \"Eryn\" is fashioned from Sitka spruce and has a dining area, sink and slightly undersized double bed inside; while more recent additions, \"Melody\" and \"Luna\", are fibreglass and have similar amenities but with full-size double beds that can be stowed. Each sphere is accessed via a spiral staircase wrapped around a tree, and is available to rent in temperatures as low as -20C, when even a trip to the composting toilet at the accommodation's base will feel intrepid.\nThe shape makes bespoke fittings a prerequisite, and every little detail has been meticulously crafted by Chudleigh, from walnut fold-out furniture that maximises the space, to door handles cast from bronze.\nInside a Brutalist building in Singapore's Chinatown lies a surprisingly serene interior. Opened in 2021 and based on an aesthetic it describes as \"soft minimalist\",KINN Capsuleoffers a Zen take on the capsule concept with walls painted in calming peachy tones and pale wood sleeping chambers fitted with crisp white bed linen. Even the smell of the place seems an antidote to its urban location as a special house fragrance designed to evoke the wildflowers of a Nordic forest hangs in the air. There are 72 capsules in total, sealed off with blackout blinds and spread across seven rooms, but the vibe is more boutique than bunkhouse.\nA traditional mud and woodfarmhousein eastern China's Zhejiang Province got a prize-winning makeover in 2019 when it reopened asa capsule hostel, bookstore and community library, sleeping 20 in tiny single bed-sized compartments concealed between bookshelves made of local bamboo. A smattering of small landings are connected by zigzagging stairways that recall the serpentine paths of the surrounding forests of Tonglu. It's hard to know which is more dramatic: the remote building's transparent floor-to-ceiling panels that light it up like a cathedral at night, or the lush mountainous scenery that's visible through them.\nIn Oud Zuid, one of Amsterdam's most upscale neighbourhoods, guests are paying to sleep in cupboards. The quirkyDe Bedstee Hoteldraws on the 17th-Century tradition of the Dutch bedstee (box bed), a bed concealed behind cupboard doors to create a cosy sleeping nook. The hotel's Art Deco features and acid-coloured wallpapers downstairs give way to a shabby-chic design in the first-floor dormitories, where the bedstee windows are framed by red gingham curtains and little wooden ladders lead to the capsules above. Relax in the hotel's small terrace garden or take a half-hour stroll to theRembrandt House Museumin the city centre to see several historic box beds in situ.\nAnother hotel with a signature smell is theResol Poshtelin Tokyo's Asakusa district – the Resol Hotel chain's first venture into capsule sleeping. The aroma, which includes orange, chamomile and neroli, is said to induce \"a feeling of gentle calm\" – of benefit, perhaps, given the communal sleeping arrangements.

It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem.

Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimedfilm productionsandinfluential namesdrawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, fromfashiontosportstoentertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's seriesThe White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink'sLisa Manobal,Patravadi Mejudhon,Tayme Thapthimthongand actor, model and businessmanDom Hetrakuljoin the star-studded cast.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui.\nHome to theFour Seasons Resort Koh Samuiwhere much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed,Koh Samuiis perhaps the ultimate White Lotusset-jettingdestination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night – daytime, office hours – we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likesSummer by Coco Tam,The ShackandGusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt,Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish andyum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui – and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns – you name it – Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nWebsite:https://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in thetrailer.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot isKo Pha Nganisland, about 38km from Koh Samui – eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for theFull Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds – the parties attract thousands of attendants – Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies theMu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available onKo Wua Talap, the park's largest island,  Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommendedTa Khairestaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to theAnantara Mai Khao Phuketresort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach – Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest calledBaan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such asmee hokkien(chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional – truly local – food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titledGrand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\nAs a sports enthusiast – he practices Muay Thai – Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan ofUFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand – \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says – the actor recommends stopping by theRajadamnern Stadiumin his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring – the only one of its kind in the world.\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nWebsite:https://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\nInstagram:@rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 onUnesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist templeWat Pho, credited as thebirthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\nAs home to theWatpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nWebsite:https://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

Here are his local favourites, from concerts at Red Rocks to wine at Sunday Vinyl.\nDenver, Colorado is known for its laid-back lifestyle, its easy access to hiking and biking and a myriad of cultural and culinary attractions.\nWith the Rocky Mountains as its backdrop, the Mile High City's glittering skyscrapers and artsy vibe belie its Wild West roots.\nWesley Schultz, who along withJeremiah Fraitesis part of the internationally renowned folk-rock bandThe Lumineers, has called Denver home since 2009. Though the band formed in 2005, it was their move from New Jersey to Denver that rocketed them to stardom. Schultz credits the relocation with giving them the space as creators to define their signature energetic folk-rock style and to write the songs that have brought them their fame.\n\"We just kind of took a chance, and when we got here, it was beautiful,\" says Schultz. \"There are a lot of transplants here; the weather is gorgeous and the people are super-friendly. I love it here.\"\nDenver is also a short drive from one of the world's most unique and remarkable music venues –Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre; a venue built into and surrounded by orange-red sandstone rock formations that create a natural theatre. A bucket-list destination for performers and concert-goers alike, the stage has welcomed musical acts like The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, U2, Bob Dylan and Widespread Panic.\n\"You get a relatively intimate concert with some of the best acts in the world, who are bringing their A-game when they play there,\" says Schultz. \"The artist is in awe of what they're seeing just as much as the audience is. You're in awe of the natural beauty and it's the best venue of any I've ever played as far as sound and lighting… It's amazing that it's right in our backyard.\"\nWhether you're in town for a show at Red Rocks or otherwise, here's how Schultz recommends spending a weekend in Denver.\nOne of Schultz's favourite things to do with his family is bring them to theChildren's Museum of Denver;a venue that encourages dynamic play. \"You're kind of surprised that you don't have to sign more waivers – in a good way,\" he says.\nIntrepid youngsters can don helmets and climb to the top of a towering structure; use recycled materials to make their own creations from tools like saws, hammers and screwdrivers; play pretend at a \"supermarket\" or immerse themselves in amyriad of activities involving bubbles.\nThe museum also hosts numerous special events for children and their accompanying adults. Grown-ups can relax while watching their kids roam free in the museum's outdoor park, which features climbing, digging and water exhibits, plus a zipline. For families like Schultz's who have young ones, the Children's Museum is a place where kids get to be themselves, explore and have fun. \"It's great for new families,\" he says. \"We love to bring our kids to the Children's Museum.\"\nWebsite:https://www.mychildsmuseum.org\nAddress: 2121 Children’s Museum Drive, Denver, CO 80211\nPhone: 303-433-7444\nInstagram:@childrensmuseumdenver\nDenver's culinary scene ranges from upscale Michelin-starred restaurantsto places likeOld West-style saloons. One of the most legendary eateries isEl Taco de Mexico, an unassuming yellow stucco restaurant on 7th Avenue and Santa Fe Drive.\n\"It's a place Stealth [Ulvang, who plays keyboards for The Lumineers] took me to because he was a local and showed me the local wisdom,\" says Schultz. \"All the musicians know about this spot. Once I was there and met the guitarist from Cheap Trick – he was in town to play Red Rocks that night.\"\nOpened in 1985 by Mexico City native MaLuisa Zanabria with the help of her mother, the restaurant brought hungry Denverites a taste of Mexico City's street food. At this counter service-only eatery, patrons order off an illuminated letter board menu featuring authentic tacos, burritos, enchiladas, sopes, chiles rellenos and tamales, often smothered in its legendary green chilli. The modest restaurant has a cult following and was the recipient of aJames Beard American Classics Award in 2020.\n\"They used to be cash-only and only women work there,\" says Schultz. \"They cook using real lard, they have beef tongue and kind of exotic stuff on the menu. I always order the chile relleno burrito smothered [with green chilli] and it's life-changing.\"\nWebsite:http://www.eltacodemexico5280.com\nAddress: 714 Santa Fe Drive, Denver, CO 80204\nPhone: 303-623-3926\nInstagram:@eltacodemexicodenver\nTo enjoy the great outdoors without having to drive for hours, Schultz recommendsGolden Gate Canyon State Park; less than an hour's drive from downtown Denver.\nThe park offers 56 kms of hiking, biking and equestrian trails, with a variety of ecosystems including mountain meadows full of flowers, lush alpine streams and lakes, rocky peaks and areas densely populated with evergreen trees. It's also home to wildlife like moose, deer and bobcats and offers stunning panoramic views of the Continental Divide.\n\"I've been hiking at Golden Gate Canyon State Park – it's a really pretty hike and you feel like you're in the middle of nowhere, but it's not far from Denver at all,\" says Schultz.\nFor those who want to make their outdoor adventure into an overnight excursion, the park has campgrounds with full hookups, backcountry campsites, cabins and yurts.\nWebsite:https://cpw.state.co.us/state-parks/golden-gate-canyon-state-park\nAddress: 92 Crawford Gulch Road, Golden, CO 80403\nPhone: 303-582-3707\nInstagram:@goldengatecanyoncpw\nFor a live musical experience that's slightly more low-key than Red Rocks, Schultz recommends the classic Denver watering hole,PS Lounge.\n\"The PS Lounge is really fun. The owner used to serve Tang shots to all the ladies,\" says Schultz. \"There's a free pool table, which was great when we were poor musicians. It's a friendly, interesting, quirky place. I love it. It's right by theBluebird[Theater] and byLost Lake Lounge.\"\nWalking through the doors at PS Lounge is like going through a portal to a mid-1980s dive bar. Its octogenarian owner, Pete Siahamis, has helmed the bar for decades, serving every woman who comes in a single rose and a sugary Alabama Slammer shot. The lounge still has a jukebox, is still cash only and its walls are plastered with snapshots of its guests over the years mingled with Greek tchotchkes like a statue of the Venus de Milo tucked between bottles behind the bar, in homage to Siahamis’ Greek roots.\nAddress: 3416 E. Colfax Avenue, Denver, CO 80206\nPhone: 303-320-1200\nInstagram:@ps.lounge.denver\nRiNo, or Denver's River North neighbourhood, is an arts district known for its colourful murals, hip cocktail lounges, retail shops, galleries and upscale restaurants. Once an industrial area occupied primarily by warehouses, factories and railyards, the area began transforming a decade ago. Some of the existing buildings have remained and have new tenants, but in other cases, empty lots have been developed with new builds.\n\"The RiNo area is a place where you can walk along Larimer Street all the way to the baseball stadium,\" says Schultz. \"Once you're there, that whole area, there's stuff all around. When I first moved to Denver, there was nothing there – it was a lonesome stretch. Now it's one of the most desirable places. I really love to take friends there and just walking along there.\"\nRiNo offers easy access to the downtown and lively LoDo neighbourhoods by foot or on a bike. The city has both scooter and bike share scheme.\n\"The city is super walkable,\" says Schultz. \"They're making Denver more and more bike friendly, too. If you can take advantage of that, it’s beautiful.”\nWebsite:https://rinoartdistrict.org/\nAddress: 1320 27th Street, Ste. G, Denver\nInstagram:@rinoartdistrict\n\"A very special place for drinks [like] cocktails but especially for wine, isSunday Vinyl,\"says Schultz.\nFound just behindUnion Station, the Mediterranean tapas bar Sunday Vinyl is helmed by local restaurateur and music loverBobby Stuckey; inspired by the success of his weekly Instagram posts where he chronicled himself pairing a record with a bottle of wine.\nThey do these theme nights, where they pick a record and pair that with a drink,\" says Schultz. \"It's a whole vibe. They spent something like a half million dollars on the sound system and they just spin vinyl, that's all they do. Even for my friends that are really into music, it's cool to remember just how special it is to be around music and seeing the cover of an album, and holding a record, it's just really tangible.\"\nWebsite:https://www.sundayvinyl.com/\nAddress: 1803 16th Street, Denver, CO 80202\nPhone: 303-738-1803\nInstagram:@sundayvinyldenver\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "From bubblegum-coloured lakes in Australia to a solar-powered safari camp in Botswana, these are BBC journalists' top destinations this year.\nTravel has the power to connect, inspire and even transform us. Peering over the edge of a crashing waterfall in Newfoundland and ascending sawtooth spires in the Italian Dolomites reveal how wondrous the world can be. But while travel should be a force for good, the past year has reminded us that it also has the potential to overwhelm and even harm the places we love, and many destinations are now imposing new restrictions as they grapple with the negative effects ofovertourism.\nIn the BBC's inaugural guide to the best places to travel this year, we wanted to highlight the destinations experiencing the opposite phenomenon. Each of these 25 spots is not only welcoming visitors and offering incredible travel experiences, but also using tourism to support local communities, protect the environment or preserve their unique cultural heritage. We compiled the list with input from BBC Travel journalists and some of the world's leading sustainable travel authorities, such as theUnited Nations World Travel Organization,Sustainable Travel International, theBlack Travel Allianceand theWorld Travel & Tourism Council.\nAs tourism in many regions soars pastpre-pandemic levels, and extreme weather and climate change reveal the fragile impermanence of many bucket-list destinations, travelling thoughtfully means considering where your trip can serve a larger good.\nFrom trekking through a moonlike landscape in Bolivia to Arctic glamping in Greenland on the world's largest island, your next great adventure is just ahead.\nEver wanted to swim alongside sperm whales? Dominica now offers the chance to do it in an ethical, sustainable way as part of the Caribbean island's groundbreaking commitment to marine conservation and regenerative tourism. The island nation recently established theworld's first sperm whale reserve, a protected marine area designed to safeguard its resident giants. Limited permits for whale swims ensure intimate, respectful encounters, offering visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience to share the water with these incredible cetaceans while facilitating research and creating sustainable tourism opportunities for local residents.\nNew for 2025, expanded infrastructure and systems are set to welcome visitors, including digital immigration forms to ease arrival and the development of a cable-car system taking riders fromRoseau Valleyup toBoiling Lake, one of the world's largest thermal springs. Access to the island has never been easier: on top of existing American Airlines flights from Miami, United Airlines islaunching direct flightsfrom Newark starting 15 February. Several new hotels are opening in 2025 (adding nearly 500 rooms with a 25% increase in inventory), including the six-star HiltonTranquility Beach Resort and Spain Salisbury. Or choose a tried-and-true classic such asSecret Bay,a luxury eco-property that frequently tops sustainability lists.\nDominica is also home toProject CETI, a groundbreaking international effort todecode whale language, clicks and codas, led by National Geographic Explorer David Gruber. Elsewhere, visitors can explore hidden gorges, towering waterfalls and feast on local cuisine at unique eateries, such as the farm-to-tableLacou. Dominica isn't just a destination – it's a movement to support a burgeoning model of eco-tourism that balances biodiversity conservation with economic growth, ensuring that your adventure helps protect this natural paradise for generations to come. –Pier Nirandara\nHome to one of Yayoi Kusama's iconic yellow, polka-dotted Pumpkin sculptures, the Japanese island ofNaoshimahas become a must-see destination for connoisseurs of contemporary art and architecture. Once known (if at all) for its highly polluting copper smelting industry, the island's transformation is thanks toBenesse Art Site Naoshima, which has helped create major museums and site-specific artworks in the scenically stunning (and dramaticallypopulation-dwindling) Seto Inland Sea, located between Japan's main island of Honshu and Shikoku.\nSpring 2025 sees the opening of theNaoshima New Museum of Art, designed by Tadao Ando, the award-winning architect behind nine other projects on the island. This new showcase for works by Asian artists will be a major highlight of this year'sSetouchi Triennale, with events and unveilings of artwork scattered across 17 islands and coastal areas of the Seto Inland Sea. Scheduled over 100 days and split between spring, summer and autumn to allow visitors to enjoy the region through the different seasons, this is the largest iteration of the Triennale since it began in 2010. The festival and activities of Benesse Art Site Naoshima have been instrumental in turning not only Naoshima's fortunes around but also reviving the neighbouring islands of Teshima and Inujima.\nBook ahead to visit Rei Naito and Ryue Nishizawa'sTeshima Art Museum, a one-of-a-kind synthesis of art, architecture and nature; while on Inujima, travellers will be amazed by the remains of a historic copper refinery reimagined as anepic-scale art installation. Memorable places to stay include Roka, a contemporary-styled ryokan on Naoshima, and the elegantly minimalistEspoir Innon Teshima. –Simon Richmond\nPerpetual fan favourite Italy hardly needs more press – especially in a year when its supremelyovertouristed capital, Rome, will be even more overwhelmed due to the 2025 Jubilee. But if Italy is still on your bucket list for 2025, consider taking a detour north to the Dolomite Mountains.\nFor Italians, the ruggedly beautiful Dolomites are synonymous with family fun and luxury holidays. The stunning sawtooth limestone cliffs sprawl across the regions of Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, attracting vacationing Italians in droves each year for their exquisite villages;peerless \"white week\" skiing; epic hike; and world-class, stick-to-your-ribs Alpine dishes. This classic Italian playground is often overlooked by overseas visitors – but that's all poised to change.\nThe \"Queen of the Dolomites\",Cortina d'Ampezzo, has been slated to co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The preparations, which will take place throughout 2025, include a vast series of infrastructure improvements throughout the area – all against a backdrop of pre-Olympic buzz. Visitors can expect to find expanded ski lift networks in the Dolomiti Superski area, where the towns ofAlta BadiaandVal Gardenawill launch modernised lifts and enhanced connections to public transit operating within the area. New and upgraded cable cars, lifts and gondolas will also be introduced throughout the regions' towns.\nBut the Dolomites is a thrilling destination in all seasons; visit in spring, summer and autumn to enjoy excellent trails, like 2024's newCammino Retico(The Rhaetian Way); a 170km, seven-day trail connecting remote villages between the Veneto and Trentino regions. And for pure relaxation, the luxuryAman Rosa Alpina hotelwill have its grand reopening in 2025. The property will now offer 51 guest rooms and suites, two presidential suites and the private Chalet Zeno. Visit now, before the crowds descend. –Eva Sandoval\nThere is nowhere on Earth likeGreenland. Spanning more than two million sq km, the world's largest island has a population of less than 57,000. Covered by a vast ice cap and spectacular mountains, itsunspoiled wildernessand majestic fjords aren't just acoveted geopolitical entity; they offer adventures of a lifetime.\nStunning hiking and spellbinding whale watching in summer and traditional dog sledding and the magical aurora in winter all make Greenland a bucket-list destination. However, it has been remote, expensive and time-consuming to reach – until now.\nWith the opening of a new international airport in the capital city of Nuuk and two more following in 2026, getting to Greenland has never been easier. The country is welcoming mindful adventure travellers who love exploring while also respecting its incredible nature and unique Inuit culture. Greenland hasadopted a pledge\"towards better tourism\" and a new law aims to steer funds from tourism towards benefitting local communities.\nA modern town with a historic waterfront, informative museums and impressive art galleries,Nuukis also a launchpad for hiking, fishing and glamping trips and acts as a gateway for exploring a remarkable Arctic territory. Further north inIlulissat, visitors can discover the jaw-dropping icebergs of Disko Bay and dramaticUnesco-recognised Icefjord. In the south, a region once settled by Vikings, there are gorgeous fjords and scenic green hills dotted with sheep farms. –Adrienne Murray Nielsen\nThough just one-sixth the size of England and far less visited than its more famous UK counterparts, Wales is filled with stunning national parks, awe-inspiring medieval castles and virtually no crowds – which only adds to its appeal. The new year offers travellers an additional excuse to explore one of Europe's most up-and-coming destinations: Wales is celebrating 2025 as theYear of Croeso(\"Welcome\"). The year-long event showcases Welsh culture, language and attractions while inviting visitors to \"Feel thehwyl\" – an untranslatable Welsh word describing a deep state of joy that comes from being immersed in the moment.\nIn recent years, Wales has positioned itself at the forefront of sustainable, culturally focused travel. Tourism has helped play a role in the revival of the Welsh language and the nation is in the midst of a multi-year £5 billion programme that uses tourism funds to make various destinations more environmentally sustainable. As part of its Year of Croeso, Wales isinvesting in mobility bikesto help more adventure-seekers explore its wild side. What's more, Wales is home to theWales Coast Path, the only hiking path in the world that runs the entire length of a country's coastline. –Eliot Stein\nLabrador, the mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada, is a vast, rugged region known for its windswept coastal villages, towering icebergs, subarctic forests and massive waterfalls – all underpinned by more than 9,000 years of human history. In 2025, the completion of the last stage of the 1,200kmTrans-Labrador Highway– a feat that took nearly 25 years and $1bn to build – transforms this remote 294,330 sq km landscape into a more accessible destination.\nThe new circular route (known as Expedition 51) connects Labrador with five Canadian provinces while offering detours into the US and even France (viaSt Pierre and Miquelon). To encourage sustainable tourism and celebrate the cultural heritage in this formerly isolated part of the north, the Canadian government has invested $180m into Parks Canada sites in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2025,Red Bay National Historic Site, a Unesco World Heritage Site and former Basque whaling station, will debut a new interactive boardwalk and visitor centre;L'Anse aux Meadows, home to the first Norse settlement in North America, is enhancing its ecological protections and upgrading visitor facilities; whileGros Morne National Parkwill introduce new interpretive exhibits that highlight the park's dramatic geology, wildlife and landscapes. –Diane Selkirk\nTucson has a lot to celebrate in 2025. This year marks the 10th anniversary of when it became the first city in the US to receive aUnesco City of Gastronomydistinction, as well as the 250th anniversary of the city's founding. Originally part of Mexico, the area now called Tucson will celebrate its unique multi-national history, as well as the deep-rooted Native American cultures that make it special, with a free event on 23 August featuring traditional Mexican music and dancing held at thePresidio San Agustin del Tucson. Visitors throughout the year can explore Tucson's miles ofdesert hiking trailsand historic buildings – like the 250-year-oldSan Xavier del Bac, the so-called \"White Dove of the Desert\". Preservation like this points to why the city is set to receive a Sustainability Index Award from theGlobal Destination Sustainability Movement(GDS) this year.\nBut while the building's history is impressive, the nearby gardens reveal an even richer history: they are the oldest continuously cultivated soil in the US. Four thousand years ago, the Tohono O'odham's ancestors farmed squashes, beans and corn on this land. After mixing and melding with Mexican and other Indigenous flavours over the centuries, many of these ancient herbs and crops are still staples in kitchens across the city. Diners can immerse themselves in the city's unique food scene at one of itscity-of-gastronomy-certified restaurantsorHeirloom Farmers Markets, which regularly feature unique local ingredients such as chiltepin chilis, edible cacti called nopales and prickly pear. –Lynn Brown\nKnown as the world's most isolated big city,Perth– and the state ofWestern Australia(WA) – have long played second fiddle to the east coast cities of Melbourne and Sydney. However, withAustralia's only direct flights to Europe, Perth is positioning itself as Australia's western gateway and a global aviation hub, with a $5bn redevelopment of Perth Airport set to enhance the travel experience. And withnew connections to Asia, WA is poised to become a must-visit destination in 2025.\nBut it's not just about getting here – it's about what awaits. Outside of newly cool Perth and its gorgeousSwan Valley Wine Region, WA's vast landscapes span more than 2.5 million sq km, encompassing 12,500km of pristine coastline, bubblegum-pink lakes, horizontal waterfalls, towering karri forests, wildflowers, wineries and wildlife encounters like swimming with whale sharks and snapping selfies with quokkas, the \"happiest animal in the world\". Sustainability-minded road trippers can explore it all on the new6,600km Electric Vehicle Highway, the world's longest EV charging network.\nWA is also championing its rich cultural heritage through the A$20mJina Aboriginal Tourism Action Planthat supports authentic Indigenous-led experiences for travellers as well as Indigenous business development.

In April 2022, the former prime minister announced Sri Lanka's bankruptcy, but anew presidentaims to rebuild the country's fortunes after it was hit by a pandemic and civil unrest.\nThe resilient island nation is hoping to get back on its feet through tourism. The city ofKandywill see the opening of its first seven-star hotel,Aviyana Private Chalets, whileAarunya Nature Resorthas a new family villa that includes an oculus for stargazing. There's a$1bn megaresortopening in Colombo, and the launch of Sri Lanka's new airlineAir Ceilão, which will fly as far as Europe and Australia. The nation also recently launched theGood Travel Seal initiative, which celebrates local businesses who have adopted sustainable practices.\nVisitors looking for a coolcation can take alegendary train rideinto its mountainous interior, or travel to Colombo and Galle to discover a new generation of mixologists putting their spin on arrack, a 5th-Century drink. The island has also opened the 300kmPekoe Trail, which takes hikers through tea plantations and rural villages in the Central Highlands. For those who want to cover more ground, an innovative startup allows travellers toself-drive a tuk tukacross the island, with the money going directly to the owner. –Claire Turrell\nAfter managing the Panama Canal for decades, the US handed control of it over to Panama at the end of 1999 in a treaty signed by the late US President Jimmy Carter. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Panama's sovereignty over its namesake waterway, and as President-elect Donald Trumphints at the possibilityof using military force to reseize it, a series of new permanent exhibits at the landmark'sMuseo del Canalhighlighting its path to Panamanian rule feels especially timely.\nYet, there's more to see in this nation of vast jungles, idyllic islands and mountainous forests beyond the canal. In 2024, theMeaningful Travel Map to Panamalaunched in partnership with non-profit Tourism Cares to make it easier for visitors to find locally led travel experiences across the country. After embarking on aLocalinptywalking tour through Panama City's Casco Antiguo and El Chorrillo neighbourhoods, head south-west to the La Pintada district, where artists weave fibers to make traditional Panama hats by hand – a Unesco-recognised practice known assombrero pintao. InEl Valle de Anton(named one of the best community tourism villages byUN Tourism in 2024) take a hike through a lush cloud forest on theCerro Gaital Lookout Trailwhere you can see both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea on a clear day from the summit. This newly opened path is part of Panama's ongoing1,000 km of Trailsproject, which seeks to boost sustainable tourism in rural communities while bringing hikers face to face withPanama's staggering biodiversity. –Kathleen Rellihan\nSnowcapped mountains, sweeping deserts, ancient cities andrich cultural heritagehave long made Morocco one of North Africa's most popular destinations. But theAl Haouz earthquake of September 2023not only devastated parts of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains, it also severely impacted tourism. As Morocco continues to build (and rebuild) its tourism infrastructure in preparation forco-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the nation is aiming todouble its tourist arrivalsin the next five years.\nBypass the crowds by taking a road trip through the Rif Mountains in Morocco's less-frequented northern region.The planned 2025-2027 expansionof Morocco's High-Speed Rail (HSR) network will create a multitude of new train lines, including a link from Rabat to the ancient, 1,300-year-old walled Rif Mountain city ofFez; home to aUnesco World Heritage medinaand the host of several games in theAfrica Cup of Nations 2025. From Fez, it's a 65km drive north to Moulay Idriss, an ancient hilltop village once closed to non-Muslims. Pass through olive and almond groves and mountain villages for a stop inOuezzane– a centre of Sufism – then continue north toTalassemtane National Parkto hike through cedar forests, climb craggy red peaks and dive into natural swimming holes. Further north is the town ofChefchaouen, known as the \"Blue Pearl\" for its blue-painted buildings and streets. Finally, cruise along Morocco's northern coast, unwinding in sleepy Mediterranean fishing villages likeEl Jebhaand the white-washed Spanish colonial buildings ofTetouan. –Alicia Erickson\nThe northern English city ofBradfordis finally poised to step out from the long shadow cast by its giant Yorkshire neighbour, Leeds, as it takes its place as the2025 UK City of Culture. A fabulousyear-long programme of eventsincludes the re-opening of theNational Science and Media Museum, plus innovative celebrations of local cultural icons: more than 400 works by Bradford-born artist David Hockneyheld in a Unesco World Heritage 1850s mill; newdigital takeson a fantasy world dreamed up by the famed literary Brontë sisters; and a musical programme mixing anelectronic bassline symphony,old factory folk music,brass bandsandSouth Asian sounds.\nThe diversity of offerings reflects the eye-opening variety of a city whose historic enclaves like Little Germany – where 19th-Century Teutonic wool merchants built an array of neoclassical warehouses – are complemented by a landscape of dramatic moors that play host to an extraordinaryopen-air immersive sound walkmixing contemporary classical music with asculpture trail. A special energy also comes from the local residents who represent diverse backgrounds (and youth – a quarter are under 20 years old).\nBradford's historic streets and rugged country setting helped the city become Britain's firstUnesco City of Film(an accolade shared with places as varied as Rome, Sydney and Busan) – a setting for screen hits including BBC series like Peaky Blinders and Gentleman Jack, and classic films like The Railway Children andWuthering Heights.\nAnd this year, there's even aninteractive cookbook project, celebrating recipes from local communities and showing that in 2025, Bradford is truly a destination to please all tastes. –Norman Miller\nHome to some of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes and the ancient capital of one of history'smost mysterious civilisations, Jordan never fails to evoke wonder. But take a closer look and you'll find that the country has been quietly building up its reputation as the Middle East's go-to destination for outdoor adventure-seekers.\nIn 2023, a stunning new 10-day, 120km-long hiking path known as theWadi Rum Trailopened, which weaves through the rust-red walls of Jordan's iconic Wadi Rum, tracing the otherworldly landscapes featured in the films Star Wars, Dune and The Martian. Visitors have traditionally breezed through the desert here on 4x4 tours, but this community tourism project promotesa slower, more sustainable form of travelthat protects the desert's delicate ecosystem while safeguarding the rich cultural heritage of the local Bedouin community.\nElsewhere, this Maine-sized nation is teeming with 33 protected land and marine ecosystems. At theWadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve(the world's lowest-lying nature reserve at 410m below sea level), visitors can search for the illusive desert-dwelling Nubian ibex while climbing, swimming and sliding their way through a sandstone gorge to the base of a crashing waterfall.The Dana Biosphere Reserve(Jordan's largest), is home to 180 bird species and 25 endangered mammal species. The rich coral reefs of theAqaba Marine Reserve, which was added to theIUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areasin January 2025, support more than 500 fish species and a growingdivingscene. –Florence Craig\nAlmost completely isolated from the outside world for centuries, this erstwhile hermit kingdom nestled in the Himalayas only began welcoming foreigners in 1974. It's since become a global leader in sustainability: it's theworld's first carbon-negative nation, more than 60% of its land is protected forest and it measuresGross National Happinessinstead of GDP.\nThe Haa Valley, a pristine forested district along Bhutan's western frontier with Tibet, has long been the country's best-kept secret: a culturally distinct region still untouched by mass tourism. This forgotten corner of the Thunder Dragon Kingdom was the last district to open to foreigners in 2002, and today, fewer than 2% of international travellers visit, despite it being a yak's graze from Paro International Airport. It's now emerging from the shadows, balancing preservation with thoughtful development in its bid for more visitors.\nTravellers can explore Haa's raw beauty through the newly restored 400kmTrans Bhutan Trail; the freshly-added 11kmHaa Panorama Trail(a revival of an ancient route); and the two-dayJoy Bay Tsho Trek, which snakes through pastures, canopy forests and bamboo groves between the villages of Mochu and Youkha.\nHaa's commitment to sustainable tourism means you'll find locally run homestays (and some local hotels) offering glimpses into centuries-old rural life. Two distinct, low-impact accommodations have also opened: the community-runKatsho Eco Camp, built along the Haa Panorama Trail by guides and cooks who lost their jobs during the pandemic, and the luxurySangwa Camp.Here, visitors witness local culture, likeBon ritualsand rare experiences such as breakfast in Bhutan'slone strict nature reserve, a highly protected biodiversity hotspot home to rare species like the red panda and snow leopard.\nWith Bhutan'sSustainable Daily Feehalved through 2027 (now $100), this once-secluded paradise is now more accessible while remaining just as committed to low-impact tourism. –Erin Levi\nMore than a year after a series of deadly wildfiresdevastated Maui, the entire state is experiencing a dramaticdownturnin visitors.

As such, the programme pairs travellers with more than 350 volunteer opportunities, ranging fromrestoring native foreststosewing and cookingwith Maui families tohelping to preserve plant and animal habitatson the slopes of Mount Kea. In exchange, travellers receive discounted – or in some cases, free – stays atdozens of hotels and resorts across the islands, including the famousFour Seasons Resort Maui at Waileawhere the first season of The White Lotus was filmed. –Eliot Stein\nUzbekistan has one of the youngest populations in the world – more than 60% are under 30. Being surrounded by a sea of young people on Tashkent's metros, which double as art museums with Soviet-era mosaics, you can see a new generation taking over. As the country strives to maintain its unique traditions and cultures, it is investing in tourism with new hotels, train routes, domestic flights and cultural attractions to grow its economy, retain its youth and attract more visitors.\nUzbekistan is getting its first major international biennial with theBukhara Biennialin September 2025. Other major cultural developments include anexpansion of the State Museum of Artsdesigned by Tadao Ando and the restoration and partial reconstruction of thePalace of Prince Romanov.\nAs of May 2024,citizens of more than 90 countries(including the UK, Canada and Australia) can visit Uzbekistan without a visa. The president has said he intends to create aGlobal Green Tourism Startup Labto bring together the country's commitment to a green economy with tourism. Crossing the border with neighbouring countries has also become easier. The region's first international railway route, theSilk Road railway tour, launched in November 2024 and now connects Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. –Kathleen Rellihan\nHaida Gwaii, an archipelago of more than 150 islands off the coast of British Columbia, offers more than breathtaking landscapes – it provides a profound connection to nature, culture and history. Isolated from the mainland, the ecologically rich islands are home to more than 6,800 species, including endemic birds, mammals and plants that have sustained the Haida People for at least 15,000 years.\nWhat makes Haida Gwaii a standout destination in 2025 is the groundbreakingGaayhllxid/Gíihlagalgang \"Rising Tide\" Haida Title Lands Agreement. This legislation marks a transformative moment in Indigenous rights in Canada, officially recognising the Council of the Haida Nation as the territory's governing body under federal law. This shift is working to revitalise Haida culture and strengthen their environmental stewardship.\nVisitors can explore long-abandoned Haida villages likeSG̱ang Gwaay, a Unesco World Heritage Site with ancient mortuary poles and longhouse remains; and encounter distinctive wildlife such as theHaida Gwaii black bear(calledtaanin the local dialect) and seabirds like puffins and ancient murrelets. Upon arrival, guests are introduced to Haida Laws, including the concept ofGina 'waadluxan gud ad kwaagid(\"everything depends on everything else\"), a teaching that underscores our shared responsibility to care for the Earth. –Diane Selkirk\nHome to mist-shrouded rainforests, emerald lakes, towering volcanoes and one of the Americas' oldest and most attractive cities (Unesco-enshrinedGranada, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in December 2024), Central America's largest country remains one of its least visited. That may soon change with the opening of the new Carretera Costanera: a $400m, 350km-long highway linking 53 beaches along the nation's Pacific Coast, from the Gulf of Fonseca in the north to the turquoise waters of Playa El Naranjo in the south.\n\nSet to be completed in 2025, the ambitious new infrastructure project makes it much easier to shoot south from Nicaragua's sprawling capital, Managua, to the tropical forests and the world-class surf hubs of San Juan del Sur and Popoyo along the country's 50km-long Emerald Coast – which has been luring in-the-know backpackers for years. More importantly, the Costanera is aiming to breathe new economic life into the nation, which isone of the poorestin the Western hemisphere and views itsgrowing tourism sectoras key to its economic growth.\nAfter learning to ride a wave at a locally ownedsurf campand sleeping in atreehousetucked inside a rainforest, venture to theRefugio de Vida Silvestre La Florat the highway's southern tip, where thousands of endangered olive ridley and leatherback turtles lay their eggs between September and October in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. –Eliot Stein\nDespite being ringed on all sides by the UK – Northern Ireland to the west, Scotland to the north, England to the east and Wales to the south – this cliff-fringed island isn't actually part of the Commonwealth. Instead, the self-governing isle is said to be ruled by the world's oldest continuous parliament, the Tynwald, and it's committed to preserving its distinct character and developing a sustainable tourism model.\nAwash with ancient historical sites, such asCashtal yn Ard(\"Castle of the Height\", the largest Neolithic tomb in the British Isles) andCastle Rushen(one of the most complete medieval structures in Europe), the 85,000-resident island is decidedly forward-thinking. In 2016 it was recognised as aUnesco Biosphere(the world's only self-governing territory whose entire land and sea area has such designation) for its commitment to environmental preservation and cultural heritage. This year, witness the isle's spectacular native bird species at the newManx Birdlife Point of Ayre National Reserve, which opened to the public in July 2024. Also on tap for 2025 is the 175th anniversary ofOkell's Brewery, so celebrate this iconic Manx brew by partaking in tasting tours that will be held throughout the year.\nIn addition to learning a few words in Manx Gaelic (the island's historical language) and familiarising yourself with the Manx pound (the island's unique currency), one of the best ways to understand this unique British Crown Dependency is toexplore it on foot. Taking advantage of the isle'smyriadof organisedwalking events, hikers will find rolling English fields, misty Irish hills and craggy Welsh coastlines – as well as dramatic Scottish Highland-esque peaks on the Isle's highest point, Snaefell mountain. On a clear day, trekkers can turn in a circle on its wind-whipped summit to see each country in the UK and Ireland. –Lynn Brown\nPakistan is one of the world's most populated nations, yet it remains one of the great surprises for travellers. That may soon change, as the country is hoping a slew ofresponsible tourism initiativesandnew sustainable effortswill lure eco-conscious visitors to explore its breathtaking northern regions; home to five of the planet's 14 peaks towering over 8,000m – including the world's second highest, K2.\nSalam Pakistan(Pakistan's first-ever national tourism brand, which launched in 2023) allows travellers to easily apply for e-visas and make bookings on the digital platform, including the coveted mountaineering and trekking visa. It only takes a quick glance at the list ofmountain peaksandtreksto see the scale of Pakistan's unmatched adrenaline opportunities.\nYet, Pakistan is much more than staggering mountain trails. The scenic Gilgit-Baltistan region – dubbed \"heaven's gate\" – is brimming with lush valleys, pristine lakes and glacial waterfalls. Cradled between trails are the Hunza Valley's fragrant cherry blossoms and apricot orchards, undulating Unesco-listedDeosai plainsand Shangri-La-esque mirrored lakes. Venture towards the Pakistan-China border to find the Khunjerab Pass, which will be operationalyear-roundstarting in 2025. –Aysha Imtiaz\nMarooned in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean some 1,500km west of Lisbon, this nine-island Portuguese archipelago is one of Europe's most isolated destinations and is known for its steaming natural hot springs, jewel-coloured lakes and sparkling lava tubes. The Azores already boast some of the continent's most dramatic black-sand beaches and bestwhale-watchingopportunities, but the islands can now add another superlative to the list:Europe's largest protected marine sanctuary.\nIn a groundbreaking piece of legislation approved in October 2024, the Azores' newly designated Marine Protected Area will extend 287,000 sq km (an expanse larger than all of Great Britain) and safeguard deep-sea corals, sharks and the 28 species of whales and dolphins found here. Protecting the long-term health and biodiversity of these coral reefs will be a boon for travellers eager to participate in whale-watching and sustainable marine research expeditions in the years to come.\nElsewhere, a scenic drive from the capital of Ponta Delgada,Furnas Valleyis home to two active volcanoes. Spend some time hot spring hopping your way across the bubbling geothermal valley, wander through lush botanical gardens or enjoy a leisurely stroll inTerra Nostra Park, arguably one of Europe's most beautiful parks. Dating back to 1775, the eponymousTerra Nostra Garden Hotelis a bonafide green retreat that will offer guests 24-hour access to their newly enhanced thermal pools and jacuzzis starting in January 2025. Don't leave without sampling thecozido das Furnas– a local meat stew buried underground and slow-cooked using the volcanic hot springs' natural heat. Nearby, sample purple volcanic tea atChalet da Tia Mercês, or plan a visit to the family-ownedGorreana Tea Factory, the oldest (and only) tea plantation in Europe. –Michelle Gross\nKansas City, Missouriis making 2025 its glow-up year.

In a bid to bolster tourism and strengthen the economy, Botswana has granted visa-free entry to visitors from 104 countries in recent years – including those from the US, UK, Germany and Canada. This means more travellers can now explore Botswana's natural beauty, including the \"Elephant Capital of the World\",Chobe National Park, and the Unesco-listedOkavango Delta; a vast wetland in the Kalahari Desert that is one of the world's last havens for cheetahs and the black rhinoceros.\nThe Okavango Delta will also see a number of new openings, including the 100% solar-poweredMbamba Campin the delta's lagoon-and-savannah-dotted north, a luxury lodge offering a blend of comfort and family-friendly wildlife adventures that's slated to open in April 2025.

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "A samba queen's guide to Rio de Janeiro",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "Mayara Lima is famous for her hypnotising samba style. Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles.\nBrazilians often say that \"everything ends in samba\", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends – at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genreis said to have originated. Aside from providing entertainment, samba has played a crucial role in shaping Rio's lifestyle, including taking a central role in its Carnival celebration – the most renowned in the world.\nMore than just a genre, samba is a cultural phenomenon that helps drive the economy, with more than 150 officialrodas de samba(samba circles) across the city. At these lively gatherings, musicians sit in a circle while crowds of hundreds – or even thousands – of spectators sing along, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile,escolas de samba(community-based \"samba schools\" that organise the world-famous Carnival parade with its giant floats and thrilling costumes) elect arainha da bateria(queen of the drums) who leads the school'sbateria(drum section), captivating the crowd and forging a powerful connection between the musicians and the audience.\nBut the energy of samba can be felt in Rio all year round. Even outside Carnival season, events like samba school street rehearsals offer a vibrant and immersive experience. We askedMayara Lima, arainha de bateria(drum queen) atPararaíso do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond.\nLima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. \"I had studied other rhythms, such as ballet and jazz, but I decided to be fully dedicated to samba,\" she says.\nLima is a proudcarioca– a Rio native. \"To me, Rio is far more than just a city,\" she says. \"What makes Rio so unique is the way it combines breathtaking natural beauty – its beaches and trails – with the energy of a vibrant, urban metropolis, where every neighbourhood has its own distinct charm and history.\" She adds: \"[But] you can't talk about Rio without talking about samba, can you? Their histories are intertwined.\"\nAhead of the 2025 Carnival, which runs from 28 February to 8 March, here are five of Lima's favorite samba experiences in Rio.\nRio's samba school parade is a global spectacle every Carnival season. Of the more than 70 samba schools, only a select few belong to the elite group that takes centre stage, parading down the Sambódromo Marquês de Sapucaí during the festivities – but the schools promote several events during the year that take place in thequadras(samba school headquarters), which play a key role in strengthening ties between the schools and the local community.\nCariocas and visitors of all ages come to samba schools to watch rehearsals, participate infeijoadas(a traditional feast of black beans and pork) and enjoy live performances of the school's samba anthem; a new one is chosen each year to serve as the narrative musical thread for each performance.\n\"There are 12 main samba schools [in Rio], which means 12 opportunities to experience samba,\" says Lima. \"While there's no fixed schedule for events, something is always happening. Each school hosts feijoadas several times a year. They feature guest performers playing not just samba, but also pagode [a type of samba/subgenre of samba] and carioca funk.\"\nFor Lima, theGrêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acadêmicos do Salgueirosamba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas. \"It's a thrilling event, it often happens in the first Monday of each month,\" she says. But her favourite type of samba school event is undoubtedly street rehearsals. \"As Carnival approaches, we hold street rehearsals every Monday in front of the samba school before heading inside to continue practicing,\" she says. \"It's amazing!\"\nEach school announces its events on social media. Street rehearsals are free, but other events, such as feijoada feast and samba circles, usually require a ticket.\nWebsite:www.salgueiro.com.br\nAddress: R. Silva Teles, 104 - Andaraí\nPhone: +552238-9226\nInstagram:@salgueirooriginal\n\nPedra do Sal– a sloping set of stone steps found in Morro da Conceição, known as Rio's \"Little Africa\" – is believed to have been thebirthplace of sambain the early 20th Century. When the area served as a market for enslaved people and the unloading point for salt (salin Portuguese) shipments, it also became a gathering place for enslaved Africans, who came together tohonour their deitiesand play the instruments that became part of samba's DNA, like thepandeiro(tambourine).\nDuring the day, Pedra do Sal's rich history attracts small groups of tourists eager to understand Rio's past. But as the sun sets, the streets fill with vendors and hundreds of visitors drawn to the city's most famous roda de samba.\nOnce held only on Monday nights, the event grew so popular that organisers expanded it to four nights a week, from Friday to Monday – though Monday remains the busiest night. The music spills over Pedra do Sal's famous steps, creating an electrifying, open-air celebration.\n\"Pedra do Sal attracts such a diverse crowd – you'll find people from all over the city, from different backgrounds, and loads of tourists too,\" says Lima. \"It's a great mix, and that reflects in the music. Samba is the essence, but you'll hear other rhythms too.\"\nAddress: Rua Argemiro Bulcão, s/n, Saúde,\nInstagram:@pedradosaloficial\nIn the city's northern zone, 21km from the historicCopacabana beach, hundreds of samba enthusiasts gather at thePagode do Chineloroda in the Pilares borough, right next to the renowned samba school Caprichosos de Pilares.\nLike most rodas de samba, the gathering started with modest expectations – just a group of friends meeting every Monday for a cold beer and some samba – but the samba do Chinelo quickly became a sensation and is now one of Rio’s official rodas de samba, attracting locals and celebrities alike, and has since evolved into a professionally structured event.\n\"This is one of those places everyone goes to. It's a given that it'll be packed every Monday, with plenty of famous faces in the crowd. Sometimes you even see singers like [Grammy winner]Ludmillaperforming – it's really cool,\" says Lima.\nThe event kicks off at 18:00 and carries on into the late night. Pagode do Chinelo is also the perfect spot to experience different samba styles. \"It's a great place to enjoy a more melodic samba, which is slower, or samba partido-alto, which is faster and more upbeat. It's brilliant fun,\" says Lima.\nAddress: Rua Faleiros, 1, Pilares\nInstagram:@resenhapagodeechinelo\n4. Best for experiencing classic samba: Cacique de Ramos\nThe northern zone of the city is also home to one of Rio's most traditional rodas de samba.\nFounded in the 1960s,Cacique de Ramosbecame famous for its legendary samba gatherings, where some of the genre's most celebrated artists first rose to prominence. Often described as the \"headquarters of samba\", it has played a pivotal role in shaping Rio's Carnival culture.\n\"This is where you'll find classic samba,\" says Lima. \"Cacique de Ramos is the birthplace of many greats, including Arlindo Cruz, Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho. If you want to experience that unique energy, this is the place to go.\"\nThe samba takes place every Sunday in Cacique de Ramos samba hall, making it an ideal option for those looking to enjoy a lively evening without a late finish. \"Since it's on a Sunday, Cacique de Ramos wraps up around midnight,\" says Lima. \"So if you need to be up early the next day but still want to make the most of your weekend, it's perfect. It's definitely one of my favourites.\"\nWebsite:www.caciquederamos.com.br\nAddress: Rua Uranos, 1326 - Olaria\nPhone: +55213251-4374\nInstagram:@cacique_de_ramos\nBaródromois a well-known samba venue among cariocas and a favourite gathering spot for samba enthusiasts. The walls are adorned with Carnival costumes and masks, immersing guests in the samba atmosphere the moment they step inside.\n\"It's always buzzing, absolutely packed,\" says Lima. \"It's a bar with a proper traditional samba roda, where people clap along to the beat – it's such a great vibe. The whole place is dedicated to samba, and that's what makes it so special.\"\nThe venue is open from Tuesday to Sunday, with samba sessions every night, ranging from performances of traditional samba to live sets from samba school baterias.\nBaródromo is a popular venue that frequently fills to capacity, occasionally leading to slower service.

But despite the islands' dynamic music and festival culture, locals' favourite pastime isliming– simply hanging out.\nWe asked Trinidadian native and \"King of Soca\"Machel Montanofor the best ways to lime on his home islands. \"We are an island country of party and style,\" says the award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and actor. \"We celebrate through struggles and strife and especially celebrate our joys. Everything is a reason to come together.\"\nNo matter which island you’re on (it’s about a three-hour ferry ride between the two), you can expect to feel a lively spirit. \"Trinidad and Tobago are two pieces of one puzzle but they give you different experiences… so you get the best of both worlds,\" says Montano. \"Trinidad is where you come to experience the Carnival culture and steelpan orchestras, while Tobago, with its blue water, white-sand beaches and relaxed attitude, is somewhere you can chill and unwind.\"\nLocal island culture reflects the country's history of colonisation. \"Our style developed through the cultural influences of Spanish, English, French, Dutch, Caribbean, African and Indo-Trinidadian communities interacting with each other over time… we really blur the lines of culture,\" Montano says. \"We are a 'douglarised’ nation, meaning we’re a true mix of African and Indian cultures. We don’t just live side by side; we share our food, fashion, music and traditions.\"\nHere are Montano's favourite ways to experience Trinidad and Tobago.\nFor Montano, the best food in Trinidad and Tobago is found in the streets.\n\"Our most famous street food,doubles[curried chickpeas served on two fried flatbreads, topped with condiments like mango chutney and tamarind sauce], is available on nearly every corner. It’s a food that [harks back to] our cultural roots. It’s affordable, tasty and something we're known for internationally.\" His pro tip: find a vendor selling fresh coconut water, as locals do. \"Coconut water is the perfect pairing with any meal!\"\nWhen pressed to name a sit-down dining experience, Montano cites theBreakfast Shed: \"You know when you’re looking for good food, you’re always looking for your grandmother’s cooking? We call it the Breakfast Shed, but it’s not really a shed. It’s what you would call a modern-day food hall. They cook only local dishes with what we like to call a 'sweet hand'; this means they use the best seasonings. Everything is so tasty.\"\nMontano recommends ordering the callaloo, which is a popular Sunday dish in Trinidad and Tobago. \"[It's] a mixture of bushes [dasheen bush, also known as taro leaves] with okra and spinach and all these different things in there.\" He also recommends trying traditional stews,curries, pies or plant-based ingredients like pigeon peas: \"We call those plant-based dishes 'ground food'. Healthy food.\"\nMontano especially loves people watching at the Breakfast Shed: \"There are a lot of people from every walk of life, from salespeople to shopkeepers to students. Everyone is always rolling up to the Breakfast Shed.\"\nAddress: JFXP+M8M, Wrightson Rd, Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago\nMusic is a way of life in Trinidad and Tobago, whether you're catching a live soca performance or simply hanging out at a dive bar. Montano enjoys visitingKafe Blue, a calypso jazz cafe in Port of Spain, also known as Kaiso Blues Café. \"It’s owned by one of our favourite musicians, Carl Jacobs, who was one of the biggest producers and singers in Trinidad and Tobago when I was growing up,\" he says. \"You can see some of the greatest musicians in Trinidad… people like Leston Paul, a great jazz musician. You can also see calypso and reggae there, and pop music and even gospel music… It's a nice place to hang out with people and chat.\"\nAnother classic musical experience is visiting a panyard, a communal rehearsal space for steelpan bands. \"Even though pan music [music played on the steelpan] is associated with Carnival, travellers can also come to the islands anytime and visit a panyard,\" says Montano. \"Some of them are not active during the year, but a lot of them are, likeRenegadesandAll StarsandInvadersandPhase 2. You might pass and hear some calypso or some soca or even some classical music being played. You’ll hear all sorts of contemporary pop songs being played, too, because these bands tour the world.\" He adds: \"Nowhere else in the world would you be able to walk into an orchestral rehearsal and be a part of it and have a little lime.\"\nAddress: MF3J+JPQ, Wrightson Road, Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago\nPhone number: (868) 477-2262\nInstagram:@kafeblue.tt\nTrinidad and Tobago is famous for its lush beaches, like Montano's pick;Maracas Beach, a tropical escape on Trinidad's north coast, about a 45-minute drive from Port of Spain through the leafy green Santa Cruz mountains; found in Maracas Bay.\n\"It's surrounded by beautiful mountains and the breeze is cool, so it brings serenity to a lot of people,\" Montano says. \"The people watching is always a delight as well… people are always having fun there.\"\nHe also notes that it's one of the most popular spots on the islands to get bake and shark, an iconic Trinidadian street food sandwich made from fried shark and fried bread and topped with condiments ranging from cucumbers to pineapple to \"special things\" likeshado beni(\"like a cilantro sauce\", Montano explains). There are multiple places to get it, Montano says, includingRichard's Bake & SharkandPatsy's Bake & Shark. Just be sure to top it with whatever speaks to you most. \"Everyone has their own way of doing it,\" says Montano. \"It’s all about your personal preference.\"\nWebsite:https://mtca.gov.tt/tourism_facilities/maracas-beach-facility/\nHitting the beach isn’t the only way to commune with nature in Trinidad and Tobago. Montano recommends spending time in theNorthern Range; a lush string of mountains running throughout northern Trinidad that covers about 25% of the entire island.\n\"There are amazing forest reserves, hiking trails and waterfalls there that offer a peaceful yet breathtaking experience,\" says Montano, who suggests paying close attention to the birds. There are more than 430 different species of birds in the Northern Range, not to mention more than 100 species of mammals including red howler monkeys, ocelots, and deer. “The Northern Range is really ideal for nature lovers,\" says Montano.\nAlso known as Independence Square, the street vendor- and busker-linedBrian Lara Promenaderuns through Port of Spain’s downtown area and is a fun spot to sit and people watch. \"It’s named after one of our most famous cricketers and is always buzzing with people,\" says Montano.\nOnce you’ve absorbed the rhythms of Trinidadian life, Montano suggests strolling toQueen’s Park Savannah, a 260-acre urban park. \"You’ll see lots of joggers, food vendors and the 'Magnificent Seven' [a group of seven colonial mansions],\" Montano says. \"[It's] a great mix of daily life and cultural heritage.\"\nCarnival is \"the heart and soul of our culture\", says Montano, so make it a point to visit while it's happening – traditionally the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. \"Visitors can playmas(join in with a costume), meet incredible people, taste authentic local foods and immerse themselves in music and dance. It’s a full spectrum of art, expression and unity that showcases the creativity of our people.\"\nTo make the most of Carnival, Montano suggests heading to Trinidad and Tobago one week before the big celebrations and making sure to wear festive attire. \"The parties start the [week] before Carnival Monday, and continue every night right into J’ouvert,\" he explains. Known as the kick-off to Carnival, J’ouvert is a lively celebration that begins before sunrise on Carnival Monday morning in which partygoers dance through the streets covered in paint and mud and other substances. To do it right, wear clothes you don’t mind ruining, advises Montano. \"It’s the most fun to be dabbed in paint and powder and sometimes even chocolate,\" he says. \"Then you go home around 06:00 or 07:00, take a shower, take some rest and get back out on the road for what we call 'Monday Wear', which is when you usually wear a designer swimsuit and a little bit of your Tuesday costume.\"\nOn Tuesday, revellers dress up \"proper\" with feathers, beads and other \"fancy-looking, bright-looking, colourful-looking costumes,\" says Montano. Whatever you do, he advises, be wary of heels. \"You want to wear flats, because it’s all about jumping and waving and dancing.

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "Ireland's time-warped island of Owey is the perfect place to disconnect",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "Located off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life – and adventurous travellers are welcome.\nFriday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades.\nLocated off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (orUaighin Irish, meaning \"cave\") is approximately 15 minutes by boat fromCruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation – and modern-day pressures – further away.\nLast inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.\nI was spending a long weekend on Owey with theWild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group \"somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible\".\nShe explained: \"It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming.\" she added.\nPaul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height ofthe Troubles. \"My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,\" explained Cowan. \"The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].\"\nHaving since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.\nDespite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.\nSeeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.\nOwey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.\nSix of our 14-strong group were staying inOwey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.\nThe hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.\nOne local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. \"Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,\" he said.\nAlongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. \"But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,\" he added.\nGallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare – and noisy – bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.\nThe hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.\nThe car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the \"village centre\" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.\nFragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.\nBy contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren – too rough to live on – with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.\nA highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves withSelkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.\nTo enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.\nPlunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed – engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.\nMore like this:\n•The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town\n•The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'\n•Ireland's heartbreaking walk of forced emigration\n\nOur last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals – who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend – joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.\nSitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition ofthe Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, \"We're winning aren't we?\". Even though I'd only met her a couple of days before, I knew exactly what she meant: the fresh air, the island's stories relayed through song, the stars so visible in the night sky… the peacefulness of Owey.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

The elaborate meal – consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf,shish tawook(a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts – was delicious.\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog,Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition – the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumptionskyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted avideoof Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and mylocal tour guidein Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding atEl Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\nOm Ali, which means \"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\nOm Ali was the first wife of the first sultan of theMamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew theAyyubid dynastyand established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Shajar Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing Al-Durr, Om Ali instructed her cook to bake something special to commemorate her success and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" saysDr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder… I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titledKitāb nasị̄hạt al-anām fī hụsn al-tạʻām, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread calledroqaqsince ancient times,\" she says. According to the bookThe Pharaoh's Kitchenby Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil – in this case, the unjust queen.\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama seriesAbbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts thelegend of Om Alito his onscreen family.\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providinginstant nourishment to a fasting bodythat has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (Acalorie analysisreveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts likekunefeand baklava.)\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad – a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

By 2023, however that number had surged to 2.21 million, far outpacing Iceland's tiny population of around 380,000. Experts chalk it up to a mix of savvy marketing, social media virality and sheer natural spectacle. The2014 #MyStopover campaignturned layovers into week-long adventures, flooding Instagram with images of steaming hot springs, glacier lagoons and volcanic black-sand beaches. Soon, Iceland was no longer just a niche destination for intrepid explorers; it was on every traveller's bucket list. But with soaring popularity came new challenges, pushing the country to grapple with the pressures of overtourism.\nMost visitors touch down in the capital city ofReykjavikand make a beeline for theBlue Lagoonor the well-troddenGolden Circle. But as Iceland's tourism boom shows no signs of slowing, the country is looking for ways to ease the strain on its most popular spots. The conversation around overtourism has become impossible to ignore, and one solution is clear: encouraging travellers to venture beyond the usual highlights. The country's north, with its dramatic fjords and geothermal hotspots, offers a quieter yet equally spectacular alternative to the capital, with idyllic towns likeAkureyriand Húsavík providing a gateway to breathtaking landscapes without the crowds.\nHúsavík is the country'soldest settlement as well as its whale capital. The small coastal town was once known for its whaling industry, and indeed Iceland is still one of only three countries that allows commercial whaling. However, many former whale hunting boats are now being converted to whale watching vessels in an effort to attract more visitors.\n\"I've been told there's a 97% chance of seeing a whale on any trip you take here,\" said BBC Travel Show presenter Roma Wells. \"Depending on what time of year you visit, you can see all sorts of different species.\"\nThat's because a variety of whales, including humpbacks, orcas and minkes, migrate through this area. In addition, many whale-watching vessels use electric rather than diesel engines, creating a quieter, more relaxing experience for both passengers and sealife.\nThe northern part of the country is also a great place to get a glimpse of Icelandic history and culture. Start in the town of Sauðárkrókur, around 200km west of Húsavík, visitors can explore1238: The Battle of Iceland– a museum and virtual-reality experience that allows visitors to be a part of the renowned battle of Örlygsstaðir, which is recounted in one of the country's most famous Icelandic sagas. The exhibition also includes historical items from the 11th Century that provide tangible proof of the country's Viking past.\nMore like this:\n•The only place where whales come to watch you\n•Iceland's First Lady takes you on a tour of her super chill nation\n•Five extraordinary night-time experiences around the world\n\"Every generation has the responsibility to preserve history and to mediate it in a way that can be understood,\" said museum manager Freyja Rut. \"I think we've come to the next step. We need to use technology to kind of make it more interesting.\"\nAnother piece of Iceland's history is its iconic turf houses. These grass-covered dwellings, inspired by Viking longhouses, blend seamlessly into the landscape like something out of a fairy tale. Built with wood and stone and insulated with thick layers of turf, they stand as a testament to the resilience of Icelanders who found ingenious ways to survive in an unforgiving climate. The north is home to some of the country's finest examples, including theGlaumbær turf farm, a cluster of beautifully preserved homes, and the strikingVíðimýri Turf Church.\nSheep farming and knitting are also central to Icelandic heritage. The region's hardy, free-roaming sheep – believed to bedirect descendantsof those brought by Viking settlers – produce the wool used for Iceland's famous lopapeysa sweaters. Recognised worldwide for their warmth and distinctive circular yoke patterns, these sweaters are a living connection to Iceland's pastoral traditions that remain a cornerstone of rural life.\n\"Icelandic people only survived here because of the sheep,\" quippedHélène Magnússonis, one of the country's leading knit designers.\nVisitors interested in purchasing anauthentic lopapeysa sweatershould look for a label that says \"Handknitted in Iceland\" – a mark of quality that according to Magnússonis, often includes the knitter's name. Operators such asGreen EdVenturesoffer tours where travellers can learn more about Icelandic life and practice their knitting skills with a local lopapeysa expert.\nAlong with the boost in tourism, Iceland has had to wrestle withenvironmental degradationand unsafe behaviours from visitors, such astaking selfiestoo close to active volcanic sites. In 2017, the country proposed theIcelandic pledge, which encourages responsible and considerate behaviour in visitors. The hope is that the combination of this pledge and the push to encourage visitors to explore more of the country will help Iceland remain on the top of everyone's visitor list, without further damage to the local ecosystem or culture.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

Getting visitors to explore the city's varied cultural districts has long been a goal of Collin Knight, who foundedLive Like a Local Toursin 2019. As a native of Roxbury, the neighbourhood that's the beating heart of Boston's Black community, he's working to highlight the city's rich African American culture while also acknowledging Boston's history of racial tensions.\nThough Boston is perhaps most famous for its strong Irish roots, the city's Black history runs deep. Prior to the US Civil War, Boston was one of the most important stops on the Underground Railroad. The first chartered branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People civil rights organisation was founded here in 1911. Malcolm X moved to Boston 30 years later, followed by Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who considered the city his \"second home\" and fell in love with his would-be wife, Coretta Scott King, here. Today, 25 percent of Boston's population is Black – twice the percentage of the Black population in the US.\n\"When we look at downtown, the city's Eurocentric history is being glorified each and every day. They're not really talking about Native Americans and African Americans and their plight within this country and Boston's connection to slavery,\" Knight says. \"I'm trying to figure out how we can tell the whole history of Massachusetts in the city of Boston instead of just telling one part.\"\nHere are Knight's suggestions of the five best places in Boston to experience the city's vibrant modern-day Black culture, as well as the ties to its past.\n1. The National Center for Afro-American Artists\n\"The National Center for Afro-American Artists(NCAAA) houses art from some of the most prominent African American artists that have lived in the Boston area or are from the Boston area. A lot of people don't know much about it,\" Knight says. \"Dr Barry Gaither has been the curator of that museum since 1968. It was created by Dr Elma Lewis, who was the grande dame of the arts within the Boston area for many years. She was very well known for providing arts and culture to young people of colour within Boston, and Roxbury specifically.\"\nKnight's must-see experiences within the museum include seeing the narrative paintings of Roxbury legendAllan Crite, known as the \"Dean of African American artists\" in New England, thanks to his nearly 90-year career. Another highlight, says Knight, is theASPELTA exhibit displaying artefacts from Nubia. The exhibit features scores of 2,600-year-old objects recovered by archaeologists from Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard University, including a fully-accurate recreation of the interior of a Nubian tomb. \"It's pretty incredible,\" Knight says.\nWebsite:https://ncaaa.org/\nAddress: 300 Walnut Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-442-8614\nFacebook:@themuseum_ncaaa\n\n2. Nubian Markets\nThis sprawling new grocery store,halal butcher shop and fast-casual cafe, which opened in Roxbury in spring 2023, celebrates the food of the African diaspora. Its shelves are stocked with hard-to-find produce and vegetable items, and more than 30 Black-owned brands. \"It's absolutely incredible when you think about it: the halal approach, the restaurant/supermarket approach and the fact that it's a Black-owned supermarket in the middle of Roxbury,\" Knight says, noting that, historically, most grocery stores in the neighbourhood had been white-owned or run by white conglomerates.\n\"This is a very powerful thing for us as Black people,\" Knight added. \"It's not something that we've ever had in our own community… They are focused on supporting other local businesses and other vendors of colour across the country.\"\nCuts of lamb, beef, and goat sold at the shop are raised following Islamic standards to feed the city’s growing Muslim population, and many products on its shelves, sauces and spice mixes, are produced by local artisans like Cameroon native Paulette Ngachoko, founder ofHapi African Gourmet. In the cafe, menu items range from ginger beef and injera bowls to pea fritters and lamb couscous. \"I'm just excited about everything they're doing,\" Knight says.\nWebsite:https://www.nubianmarkets.com/\nAddress: 2565 Washington Street, Roxbury\nPhone: 1-617-608-4940\nInstagram: @nubianmarkets\n3. Comfort Kitchen\nThis cosy Black-, immigrant- and woman-ownedrestaurantopened in January 2023 in Dorchester's Uphams Corner neighbourhood. It was nearly a decade in the making and comes with its own dose of history: it's housed inside a 1912-built building that is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\"I love the owners over there. You think about the vibe that's in there, you think about the menu and how it's connected to the African diaspora,\" Knight says. \"[The building] was a comfort station [public restroom] for people travelling from the Dorchester area to the South Shore.\"\nInside the former bathroom, the chic 30-seat space has curved pale-pink banquettes that are an Instagram favourite. Cocktails feature Equiano, an Afro-Caribbean rum produced in Mauritius and Barbados, or pay tribute to Black engineering pioneer Lewis Latimer, who worked alongside Alexander Graham Bell to develop the telephone in Boston in the 1880s. (Non-alcoholic drinks include a take on Tootsie, a Ghanaian fermented beer or a baobab mocktail.) For dinner, munch on jackfruit sliders, jerk roasted duck or za'atar brown butter trout.\nWebsite:https://www.comfortkitchenbos.com/\nAddress: 611 Columbia Road, Dorchester\nPhone: 1-617-329-6010\nInstagram: @comfortkitchenbos\n4. Wally's Cafe and Jazz Club\nWally'sis an institution in Boston's South End neighbourhood, and when founder Joseph Walcott opened the club in 1947, he was the first African American nightclub owner in New England. Walcott got his start by drawing – and often driving – musicians up from New York City and created one of the few spaces in Boston during the time of segregation where anyone of any race could mingle. Today his grandchildren run the space, which hosts music 365 nights a year, often drawing from talented students at Berklee School of Music, the New England Conservatory and other nearby institutions. It's considered theoldest jazz club in the city.\n\"What most people don't realise is there were jazz joints and juke joints up and down Massachusetts Avenue. That is the last of a dying breed that we had all over [the area] back in the day. All of the greats came to play,\" says Knight – among them Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker and Billie Holiday. Check the schedule for their funk, jazz, and salsa offerings, which run from 17:00 to 01:00 nightly.\nWebsite:https://wallyscafe.com/\nAddress: 427 Massachusetts Ave., South End\nPhone: 1-617-828-1754\nInstagram: @wallyscafejazzclub\n5. The Embrace\nThis new, massive bronze sculpture was unveiled on Boston Common this year, celebrating Boston's civil rights legacy and commemorating the period that Dr Martin Luther King Jr lived in Boston. King attended theology school at Boston University in the 1950s and met his wife, Coretta Scott King, who was attending the New England Conservatory of Music, while living in the city.\nThe sculpture, by artist Hank Willis Thomas, is an abstract depiction based on a photo of the couple embracing after King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. It also recognises a moment in April 1965 when the leader stood on the park before a crowd of 22,000 and called for Boston to live up to its ideals and create a more equitable city.\nWhile the sculpture alone \"is a really beautiful piece to tell that history, I think, more importantly, if you look at the grounds of The Embrace, you see all of these names [of people who marched alongside King and helped expand his ideas],\" Knight says. \"It's really about all of the local community advocates that have made a difference within the Roxbury community and the Boston community at large. So, I think it's an incredible tribute to Dr Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King, but it's also a tribute to our city as a whole, to talk about the Black histories of our city, of our neighbourhoods, and have it be in the middle of the Boston Common.\"\nWebsite:https://www.embraceboston.org/memorial\nAddress: Boston Common, 139 Tremont Street\nInstagram: @embracebos\n\n\nThis article was originally published on 17 June 2023 and has been updated, including the removal of one business which has since closed, Soleil restaurant.\n---\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us onFacebook, or follow us onTwitterandInstagram.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newslettercalled \"The Essential List\".

Here are his favourite bowls – from Cajun-style Brigsten's to the OG at Commander's Palace.\nThere are few things that New Orleanians feel more passionately about than their hometown's famous cuisine – unsurprisingly, since the city's historical blend of cultures has given rise to a vast array of destination-worthy dishes.\nBeignets, jambalaya,étouffée, po'boys,king cakeandmuffulettaare just a few of the city's culinary stars; their flavours reflecting its Creole, Cajun, West African and French heritage. But only one iconic NOLA dish has been named the official dish of the state of Louisiana: gumbo.\nGumbo is a thick meat, seafood and vegetable stew whose name derives fromki ngombo, the word for okra in many West African languages. It has French andWest African roots, and both Cajuns (an ethnic group ofAcadiandescent) and Creoles (people of mixed European, African, Caribbean and Native American ancestry) make the dish. Thefirst recordedmention dates to the early 19th Century when it was served at a gubernatorial reception in New Orleans.\nThere are countless variations of the Louisiana classic and no shortage of opinions on the right way to make it, but gumbo almost always starts with a roux: flour cooked in fat that forms the base of the dish. The other consistent element: the \"holy trinity\" of onion, celery and green bell pepper, ever-present in Cajun and Creole cuisine. The proteins range from seafood or poultry to ham or beef, veal or game – or a combination thereof. Tomatoes may or not be used depending on the particular preparation, but you'll often find the eponymous okra – a savoury pod-shaped green fruit that gives the stew its unique flavour.\nNOLA-based chefEmeril Lagasse– famed for bringing Creole and Cajun cuisine into America's homes via his acclaimed, long-running television series, Emeril Live  – has been making and eating gumbo since he moved to New Orleans in 1982. \"I eat it five times a week and make it at home, but there is excellent gumbo all over the city,\" he says. Though he appreciates traditional gumbo – served over rice – Lagasse offers a modern take at his flagship restaurant,Emeril's, which he says has evolved quite a bit since the space first opened in 1990. \"It used to be made with seafood,\" he says, \"then we switched to chicken sausage and now it's made with lobster.\"\nIt's not just the ingredients in the stew that have changed; the presentation has too. \"The gumbo is currently in the form of a hot canape,\" he says, \"that's the perfect concentrated taste of lobster-based gumbo made with a super dark roux.\" While his son, EJ, is now running the kitchen, Lagasse frequently wanders over to the restaurant to say hello to everyone and fix himself a bowl.\nHere are Lagasse's top picks for gumbo in the Big Easy.\nCommander's Palace, a New Orleans institution, has been a landmark in the Garden District since its founding in 1893.\nIn the 1970s, legendary Louisiana chef Paul Prudhomme helped put the restaurant on the national map for its distinct blend of Cajun and Creole cooking. In 1982, at only 23 years old, Lagasse took over from Prudhomme, continuing a tradition of \"haute Creole cuisine\", with classics such as garlic bread, turtle soup with sherry and Creole gumbo.\nEven though Lagasse left Commander's Palace in 1990, he still cites the gumbo as one of the best in NOLA because the quality of the seafood is so good. Their recipe for the stew starts with a toasty, dark roux and includes crab stock, crabs, shrimp and okra. \"Some places add chunks of seafood, but for me, that's something you do at home cause the fish starts getting stringy as it sits,\" he says.\nWebsite:https://www.commanderspalace.com/\nAddress: 1403 Washington Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70130\nPhone: +1 504-899-8221\nInstagram:@commanderspalace\nCafé Reconcile was founded in 1996 to help local 16-to-24-year-olds with career exploration and job readiness, using the restaurant as a foundation for learning and training.\nWhile most of the hundreds of interns who have been through the 14-week programme go on to work in restaurants, others become nurses, mechanics, technicians and more. What's consistent is that they all learn to cook classic New Orleans fare like red beans and rice, po'boys and gumbo. \"Café Reconcile's chicken and sausage gumbo has a rich roux with lots of okra,\" says Lagasse, \"and it always hits the spot.\" It's a win-win, according to Lagasse. \"Your meal helps support the workforce development,\" he says. \"What could be better?\"\nWebsite:https://cafereconcile.org/\nAddress: 1631 Oretha Castle Haley Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70113\nPhone: +1 504-568-1157\nInstagram:@cafereconcile\nKnown as the Queen of Creole cuisine, chef Leah Chase was the heart behind legendaryDooky Chase Restaurant, first opened in 1941 by her in-laws and later evolving into a meeting place for excellent food, music and dialogue.\nIn the upstairs dining room, many influential leaders of the civil rights movement, such as Martin Luther King Jr and the Reverend A L Davis, met to discuss crucial issues affecting the African American community.\nStarting in 1973, every year on the Thursday before Easter (Holy Thursday), Chase would cook up to 100 gallons of her special gumbo z'herbes, made with nine types of greens. \"They do a traditional style of gumbo,\" explains Lagasse, \"but during Lent it has lots of greens – mostly collards, mustard, turnip greens and okra, and it's finished with gumbo filé.\"  For decades, Chase's Lenten gumbo attracted New Orleanians from all over the city. Chase passed away in 2019 but her grandson, Edgar \"Dook\" Chase, carries on the gumbo tradition.

Instead, Brigtsen thickens the stew with filé powder, a ground spice made from sassafras leaves. \"The flavour is kind of like dehydrated greens,\" explains Lagasse. The other distinction to Brigtsen's gumbo is a little unorthodox: instead of slowly frying the oil and flour for the roux, the recipe starts with heating a pot of oil to 375F, then quickly whisking in the flour.

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "The art curator saving the world's rarest fruit",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "Former Tate Modern director Vicente Todolí founded Todolí Citrus Fundació to preserve rare citrus varieties and compile a catalogue of farming knowledge to inspire future generations.\nOur preconceptions of lemons are very rarely challenged. But on a crisp November morning on Spain's leafy Valencian coastline, Vicente Todolí is showing me the secret side of citrus – and it's unlike anything I've seen on supermarket shelves.\nThe most weird and wonderful specimens are arranged on a table in his Sun-soaked orchard. There's one shaped like an octopus with fat tentacles, a wart-covered citron the size of a newborn baby and a colourful pear-shaped fruit splattered in a tie-dye of green and yellow.\nThey're not at all what I was expecting, and they're not entirely safe, either. \"You will get burned,\" Todolí warns, pointing at a grass-greenbergamot. The oil is phototoxic, causing  the skin to burn if it's exposed to UV light (it isn't dangerous to eat, but it is very acidic). \"Want to taste?\" he asks. I hold a slice up to the sun and eye it suspiciously; the golden segments light up like a stained-glass window. I tip my head back and squeeze drops into my mouth, being careful not to touch my lips. Eye-watering acidic needles stab my tongue. I'm reeling and wiping away tears, but Todolí is already on to the next fruit, squeezing the pearly contents of a finger lime into my hand. The little balls pop like lime-flavoured caviar in my mouth.\nThere are hundreds more unusual fruits to try atTodolí Citrus Fundació, a not-for-profit farm dedicated to researching and preserving rare citrus varieties. Hidden on a sleepy street in the town of Palmera, this is Todolí's passion project. He was born and raised on this farm, going on to study art history before serving as director at esteemed galleries such asTate Modernin London and Milan'sPirelli HangarBicocca, where he works today.\nNow, Todolí considers himself a fifth-generation orange farmer. He's fiercely protective of his old family farm, which is one of the reasons Todolí Citrus Fundació came to be. In 2010, a project was launched to raze Palmera's orange groves to make room for real estate. He tried to derail it through official channels and lost. \"I was called a romantic enemy of progress,\" he recalls. But Todolí did not desist. Changing tack, he began buying plots of land. Some were abandoned patches of weeds and others were established orchards. He acquired around 4.5 hectares in total, an impenetrable fortress of precious farmland. \"When I started it was a matter of urgency, I had to save the land,\" he says.\nAround the same time, Todolí was working as cultural advisor to Ferran Adrià, former head chef of the iconic (and sadly closed)El Bulli(once-billed as theworld's best restaurant). One day, the pair visited a garden on the outskirts of Perpignan which had more than 400 types of citrus trees, some exceedingly rare. The south of France is a little too chilly for citrus, so the trees are planted in pots. In summer they bask outside, and in October the gardeners heave them into a greenhouse to keep warm. During their visit Todolí asked, \"How is it possible that they have done this amazing project with citrus, and in my area no one has done it?\" Adrià replied: \"Why not do it yourself?\"\nTodolí was inspired. He knew Palmera had the perfect microclimate for citrus; there would be no need for pots. Todolí Citrus Fundació is 3km from the sea and backed by a ripple of mountains. When the warm wind travels across the Mediterranean Sea, it becomes humid, and when it hits the mountains, it drops bathtubs of rain. The water trickles down the mountainside to Palmera, absorbing organic matter along the way. The fertile, nutrient-rich soil is known as alluvial soil, and Todolí is blessed with buckets of it.\nPalmera's crisp mornings also help to balance the flavour of fruit, Todolí explains. \"In January it's one or two degrees in the morning and around 20C in the afternoon. That's what creates the balance between acidity and sweetness. If you're in Florida, for example, it's too hot. They're sweeter but they're bland. In Japan, it's colder so they have more acidity. Here and Sicily are the perfect areas for citrus.\"\nFor inspiration, he turned to history's most illustrious citrus gardens. He studied the Italian gardens of the Medici family in the 1500s and opulent Arabic palaces like the Alhambra. \"For the Arabs, gardens appealed to the senses. It was a paradise on Earth, an immersive experience,\" says Todolí.\nLikewise, the sights, smells and sounds of Todolí Citrus Fundació seduce visitors. Chirping locusts the size of frogs hop in the mallow and honeybees buzz between wildflowers. While licking sour juice from fingertips, there's a soundtrack of water trickling along an ancient Arabic irrigation route and the frenetic chirping of goldfinches in the aviary. The zesty scent of lemons perfumes visitors' hands for the rest of the day.\nMore like this:\n•Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n•Spain's accidental tourist attraction\n•A restorative soup made for cold season\nThere are other farms nearby, but they don't look like this. The surrounding countryside is an orderly grid of single-crop fields, with rows upon rows of orange trees. Spain is theworld's leading exporterof citrus, shipping around4 million tonnesa year. In order to produce such vast quantities, most farms lean heavily on mono-cropping, which can leave soil depleted and plantsmore vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Todolí Citrus Fundació, on the other hand, is a genetic diversity bank; a motley bunch of more than 500 varieties. Some of the rarest plants include ancient Valencian orange trees used as rootstock. The grafts were made around 150 years ago and Todolí cut the scion back to allow the roots to grow freely.\n\"It's like Jurassic Park,\" he says. \"We can see resurrected varieties that were in extinction.\"\nAs well astoursof the farm, the garden comes alive witheventsthroughout the year. Poets read stanzas on a stage decorated with lemons at the annualPoecítricsfestival(14 June 2025), whileCine de Vanguardiais a celebration of experimental cinema.\nBack on the tour, and Todolí's right-hand man Ton Gjekaj is waiting at the final tasting table. He has cut the last slices of fruit. There are wedges of passionfruit-tasting trifoliate orange, apple-sour calamansi and rosewater-scented Palestinian sweet lime, still warm from the Sun. I greedily eat them all, popping whole carpels into my mouth. I try to jot down the flavours but by now my notepad is covered in juice, my camera's buttons sticky.\nThere's just time to peep inside The Laboratory, a high-tech kitchen and library. This is a hub of experimentation, used by experts from around the world who come to play with Todolí's extraordinary pantry. Chefs make ice cream from bergamots; bartenders pickle lemon rind for gin and tonics; and perfumiers extract oils from nearly extinct oranges.\nAgustina Basilico Miara, head of beverage at London'sToklasrestaurant, has visited three times and says she always goes home with new ideas. \"It's incredible. Every time we go, we take as many people as possible from the restaurant,\" Miara says. \"Especially after being in cloudy London, to arrive in an explosion of colours is super inspiring.\"\nMiara uses leftover peel from the kitchen (like fragrant blood orange and chandler red pomelo) to make a tea, which she turns into a syrup. She uses it for a variety of cocktails, like her zingy take on the classic whisky highball. \"We've also done a martini with chinotto. The vodka is infused with chinotto and then we candy the fruit,\" Miara says. \"It adds another layer, like an olive brine element to the flavour, it's very aromatic.\"\nAfter flicking through some books (every mention of citrus has been bookmarked, resulting in a pleasing rainbow of Post-it notes along the spines) we conclude the tour by tasting marmalade. The most delicious is made from Borneo lemon – not technically a lemon, but a cross between a pomelo and a key lime. Delicate and creamy, the marmalade tastes like well-balanced lemon curd.\nFor Todolí, this open-air gallery is his legacy. It's a place to challenge preconceptions, encourage biodiversity and foster local culture. \"For me, it's like a museum where you don't have to refresh the collection because it changes every day,\" he says. \"People think that citrus is what they see in the supermarkets. They don't know that it started eight million years ago, that it's one of the oldest fruits in the world. It has been so important in literature, poetry and art.\"\nTodolí can see the art of citrus – and from his otherworldly orchard, he's helping the rest of the world to see it too.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

This is a land known as theGlasriket(\"Glass Kingdom\") that's home to a string of globally renowned glassworks such asKosta BodaandOrreforswho have created crystalline gorgeousness from fiery furnaces since the 1740s.\nBut that glassmaking heritage is now matched by changemaking: this compact city of fewer than 100,000 inhabitants has become a global beacon in the battle against climate change. Nearly a decade before Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was even born, Växjö set itself on a path to a new vision of urban living that's now been emulated worldwide.\n\"It was a seminar in 1996 led by the mayor, which asked the question: 'What would it be like to live in a fossil free city?',\" explains Henrik Johansson, environmental strategist for Växjö Municipality. By the end of that meeting, a unanimous vote saw Växjö become the first city in the world to commit to become fossil fuel free. This has now evolved into a bigger target ofclimate neutrality by 2030– 15 years ahead of Sweden'snationwide commitment.\nVäxjö's groundbreaking 1990s commitment drew media coverage from as far afield as Japan, with TV crews ironically taking fuel-guzzling long-distance flights to visit the place Johansson wryly describes as \"this crazy town looking to go fossil free\". None of it seems crazy now, however, with Växjö's per capita carbon emissions slashed bymore than70%from 1990s levels, all while the city has grown in population by a third and doubled its per capita GDP.\nHere, local buses and council vehicles run on biofuel made from domestic household organic waste. More than 90% of the city's energy, meanwhile, is sourced from forestry by-products and other biomass, with plentiful material coming from the vast surrounding forests. This ranges from sawdust from local timber mills to branches left from tree-felling to make goods for IKEA – the global design giant born just a half hour train ride away in the town of Älmhult.\nThe few CO2 emissions that linger in the air stem from personal car users who are still not taking advantage of one of Sweden's best provisions of electric car charging stations, plus places to fill up on non-fossil biofuels such as ethanol.\nThe boldest transition, though, has seen Växjö become perhaps the world's leading showcase for large-scale timber architecture, with half of all new builds required to be in wood, sourced from the same sprawling forests that once provided fuel to fire the glasswork furnaces.\nI arrive in Växjö by train and can't help but start snapping pictures of a station interior unlike any I've ever seen. Stepping off the platform, I enter a seven-storey edifice that hosts both theCentral Station and Växjö City Hall, and everywhere I look, there's wood. Here, timber is used for both structure and decor in a calm, soaring space that also includes a tourist office, exhibition area and eye-catching artworks made from pale wood. It's such a welcoming space that it's been nicknamed the city's public \"living room\".\nA wooden bridge connects the station with a museum quarter that I explore the next day, featuring theSwedish Glass Museumwithin theSmålandMuseum; plus theHouse of Emigrants, which tells the often revelatory story of Swedish mass emigration to North America.\nThe museum enclave is also home to myriad relocated buildings from past centuries – I particularly like the windmill as a symbol of ancient green power, built from timbers painted the iconic Swedish shade known as Falu or Falun Red, named after its historic source from mines around the eponymous town.\nHeading down to the shore of Lake Trummen – one of two nearby lakes, along withsculpture-lined Växjösjön– I potter alonga trail of modern sculpturesthat provides a cultural promenade of contemporary works chosen and voted for by residents. Glass art is celebrated too, with contrasting crystalline creations placed along the cosmopolitan length of Sandgärdsgatan that runs through the heart of the city centre to the iconic double-spired cathedral.\nIt's a beautiful stroll, and I wonder whether people would have been so keen to leave Sweden if 19th-Century life had offered what the 21st-Century nation does. Alongside enviable public services and a famously equable society, I'm getting housing envy staring up at contrasting high-rise wooden apartment blocks that make up the award-winningKvarteret Geologenresidential complex (also known as Trummens Strand), standing tall and proud by the lake.\nHere, I'm joined by Olivia Thim, a sustainability expert for property management firm Vöfab. \"For a long time, we had thetallest wooden buildingin Sweden,\" Thim says. \"But also a diversity: apartments, sports arenas, schools. We just thought that we should try to build everything in wood first.\"\nAlso with us is architect Karin Hård Af Segerstad from leading Växjö practiceArkitektbolaget, who tells me about the super-strong cross-laminated timber (CLT) used for structural frames, augmented by cedar shaving facades and various interior woods. This swaddling in natural materials is as pleasing to the residents as it is to the eye, she says: “People report an improved sense of well-being living surrounded by wood.\"\nMore like this:\n•10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n•Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n•How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nFor architects and engineers, Växjö's showcasing of innovative timber builds has been a valuable learning curve. \"People weren't so knowledgeable about wooden high-rise buildings, so we have close collaboration with the local university,\" says Segerstad. \"Every time there was a question, there would be research done.\"\nThis includes sensors within buildings to record how the structures perform over years and changing seasons. \"Now we have researchers coming from around the world,\" she continues. \"Many from Austria and Germany, but also places in Africa such as Congo.  We have become world pioneers to build in wood.

It ascends past Andean cloud forests to Warmiwañusca, the infamous \"Dead Woman's Pass\" at 4,215m, before descending to the ancient Inca citadel ofMachu Picchu, one of theSeven New Wonders of the World.\nThis is the legendaryInca Trail, South America's most popular hike and one of the world's most jaw-droppingly beautiful treks. In an effort to protect the path, which was designed and built more than 600 years ago by Inca engineers, the Peruvian government limits the number of passes available to visitors during the trail's March-to-January opening (the trail opens 31 March 2025). As a result, every year permits for the 43km hike sell out quickly as travellers try to secure one of the roughly 200 daily passes allocated daily for tourists.\nIronically, the Inca Trail's popularity contrasts with frequent protests that often leavehundreds of travellers stranded, as the porters tasked with hauling hikers' gear across the mountains petition for better working conditions. While these protests rarely reach English-language publications, thePorters' Voice Collective(an organisation aiming to elevate the rights of Inca Trail workers) released adocumentaryin 2024 detailing these struggles.\nHow can such an idyllic place hike generate so much conflict? According to the trail's Indigenous guides, the problem is a lack of law enforcement governing porters' working conditions.\nSince mules are prohibited on the Inca Trail because their hooves would destroy the ancient stone paving and stairs, trekkers are required to hire porters to haul their camping equipment. Porters' days often begin at 05:00 and end after 22:00. While a 2022 law mandates that porters receive s/650 Peruvian Nuevo Soles (£140 or $176) for the four-day trek, very few trekking agencies abide by this and pay as little as s/350 (£75 or $95) per trek. Since the law was passed, trekking agency lawyers have been fighting it, and in the meantime refusing to pay the legal wage.\nIn addition to trekking agencies not compensating porters properly, many companies require their porters to carry more weight than the20kg maximum thatis also stipulated in the law.\n\"Most [male] porters carry about 30kg, and I've seen 40kg packs,\" says Natalia Amao Huillca, who has been guiding travellers along the Inca Trail since 2007. \"About 80% of the injuries I see in porters are knee injuries. The others are mostly back injuries. They frequently ask me for pain pills in the evening.\"\nAccording to Cenovia Quispe Flores, who has worked as a porter forEvolution Treks Perusince 2018, \"The law for women is 15kg,\" but she says she has seen women working for other companies carrying 25 to 30kg. To get around weight limits, many companies either send gear around the first checkpoint where porters' backpacks are weighed or simply pay those off who enforce these limits.\n\"In theory, the checkpoint is strict, but in practice, it's not strict for everybody,\" explains Shandira Arque Lucana, who has guided hikers on the Inca Trail since 2016. She says that big companies cut deals with people working the checkpoints but that small companies don't have enough influence to evade enforcement.\nEven companies that want to play by the rules can find themselves stymied by the strict limit of 500 total people (which includes 300 non-tourist porters and guides) allowed on the trail each day. Sometimes there is extra weight but no way to add an extra porter.\n\"I've seen many porters working with hernias, bad knees and ankle problems,\" says Pedro, a guide who asked not to be identified by his real name. \"I know a porter who became an alcoholic because he couldn't get treatment for his injured knee. He still works on the Inca Trail, and he dulls the pain withcañazo(a liquor made from sugarcane)\".\nPorters also suffer from dehydration. They drink unclean water from streams and handwashing taps near bathrooms, though paying customers get filtered and boiled water.\nWith all this in mind, what should travellers know if they want to trek South America's most famous ruins in a responsible, ethical way? According to local guides, the first thing to remember is that there are other treks that lead to Machu Picchu.\n\"The Inca Trail is not the only option,\" says Liz Montesinos Pumayalle, who has worked as a guide on the Inca Trail for eight years and notes that mules are used instead of porters on all other trails. \"People who want to connect with Indigenous communities should hike theLares Trek. TheSalkantay Trek(which has two options that connect to Machu Picchu directly and other routes that connect indirectly) is best for people who want to sleep in eco-domes or lodges, rather than tents.\"\nAmao Huillca notes that companies who hire many female porters often treat their staff better than those who only have one or none. \"I like working with porter teams that are half women and have a woman head porter,\" she says. \"Most companies send one or two token women porters.\" She says that because female porters are more inclined to go to a doctor when they're injured than their male colleagues, tourists who request women porters are more likely to trek with healthier porters.\n\"One way to ensure that porters are treated and paid well is for there to be women porters,\" echoes Inca Trail guide Edson Lucana Mejía. He explains that it has historically been common for male porters to sleep in the dining tent, which doesn't have a floor and is often muddy. Women usually insist on individual tents, so in a team with more women, you can be sure that more porters have a decent place to sleep.\nMarco Antonio Carrión, who has been guiding treks on the Inca Trail for 20 years offers other recommendations. \"Look for photos of porters with ergonomic backpacks and for reviews that mention something about how porters are treated,\" he says. \"If a company is sustainable and treats the porters well, it will show in the online reviews.\"\nIn addition, Carrión says travellers should ask if porters are required to wear their employer's uniforms. While it may be a small detail in some cultures, for many Indigenous Peruvians, traditional Quechua clothing is an important part of their identity.\nDespite allegations of mistreatment by certain Inca Trail operators, many guides and porters not only feel fulfilled, but also fortunate to work in such a stunning natural setting. \"I love this work\" says Quispe Flores. \"I like the mountains and working with my friends, the other women porters. Working in agriculture is harder and doesn't pay.\"\nWhile it isn't always easy to determine which companies follow the law and which don't, Lucana Mejía has one message he wishes the many thousands of travellers hoping to hike the fabled route will remember: \"Without porters, there is no Inca Trail.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

From the boat, I couldn't see much beyond a few residential buildings and lots of giant construction machinery, but, as an architect, I was interested to know more.\nSo, 12 months later, I returned to Copenhagen and headed back to Nordhavn, just a 15-minute metro ride from Copenhagen's central station.\nThis time, standing at Århusgadekvarteret, the core of the new development, I could see gleaming apartment buildings, high-end office spaces and a cafe-lined boardwalk along the previously industrial harbour. Dozens of people were lying on colourful beach towels spread across the waterfront, all soaking in the Scandinavian summer sun. It was a peaceful, serene scene, with none of the morning commuter chaos I was used to seeing in cities around the world.\nAnd that's because Nordhavn has been specifically designed to make life easier.\n\"Although it looks like any modern district, it's the world's first five-minute city,\" explained my guide, Bente Hoffman from immersive cultural tour companySlow Tours. \"When the project is complete, everything you need will be within a 400m walk.\"\nCommuting is one of the biggest challenges of modern life as it adds so much time into the daily routine. Nordhavn (officially a district of Copenhagen, but described asa citydue to its scale and scope) has been designed to make everything – from schools and play areas to businesses and recreational spaces – accessible within five minutes. It is setting a blueprint for a world where residents can fit in a morning workout before strolling to the office, grab lunch at a cute cafe, have a quick swim at the harbour and still make it home in time to take your kids to the playground – all before enjoying a cosy candlelit dinner at home.\nImagine doing all of this without driving from one point to another, without feeling exhausted, and being able to repeat it every day while staying carbon neutral.\n\"We are creating a neighbourhood that meets everyday needs and special occasions,\" explained Peter Bur Andersen, an architect from BRIQ Studios that played a crucial role in zoning Nordhavn. \"Everything is within walking or biking distance, minimising the need for commuting. The area also promotes a mostly car-free lifestyle, connected by cycle paths and the metro.\"\nCopenhagen is currently theUnesco World's Architecture Capital(until 2026) and innovative solutions for smart living have been brewing across the Danish capital: fromPaper Island, designed to focus on public spaces and housing for all income groups; toCarlsberg City Districtthat's built on four pillars of beer production: science, innovation, art and culture.\nHowever, Nordhavn'sfive-minutecity concept is unique. While there are a few 10-minute cities being developed around the world, including one inSeoul, South Korea, Nordhavn's one-of-a-kind concept isthe most ambitious urban development projectin Scandinavia. It is also the only new urban district anywhere in the world to receive a gold certification for sustainability from the German Sustainable Building Council, orDGNB(the largest network for sustainable building in Europe), according to Andersen.\nIn Nordhavn, sustainability is about more than reducing energy consumption. Every building constructed must consider its social, economic and environmental impact. For example, theBig Bio Cinema– the city's newest theatre – is constructed from recyclable materials such as aluminium in case the building ever needs to be demolished.\nAnd, according to Anderson, social and economic inclusion has been at the core of all planning. \"It is important to bring back what worked well in history,\" he said. \"We used to have the butcher, craftsman, baker and cheese shop – that diversity in everyday encounters. The future city should mix recreational, cultural and commercial spaces, all easily accessible within the neighbourhood.\"\nBut until relatively recently, no one would have considered living in this once-industrial district. Irshia Nasreen, an engineer born and raised in central Copenhagen, says, \"While I was trying to find a new neighbourhood to move out of the city centre, I never thought I'd move here.\"\nBente adds, \"I didn't think I would do tourist walks in Norhavn. There was nothing to see.\"\nAfter all, for centuries Nordhavn was a free port filled with cargo ships, grain silos and metal containers. The buildings that existed were warehouses and industrial shipping structures. Then, in 2008, a competition was held to create a sustainable neighbourhood for Copenhagen's future: 179 proposals were submitted and a group of four architectural firms, COBE Architects, Sleth, Rambøll and Polyform were winners.\nThey designed an urban area of \"soft mobility\", where it is easier to walk, bike or use public transport than it is to drive; and put the idea of hybrid spaces – something that \"avoids creating lifeless spaces and fosters community among residents, employees and visitors\", according to Andersen – at its heart. For example, in Nordhavn, a multi-storey car park might have a gym on its roof; an apartment building could include a public restaurant; and a hotel could house a concept store.\nAlthough the entire Nordhavn project won't be finished until 2060, it is being developed in islets (small islands), with key areas such as Nordø and Århusgadekvarteret, already complete and full of life, brimming with locals and tourists. A metro extension to Nordhavn and Orientkaj opened in 2020, providing easy access from the city centre.\nMore like this:\n•10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n•Kamikochi: Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n•How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nAs Hoffman and I walked through Nordø, I admired the ingenuity of using once-unassuming buildings to create chic destinations.Audo House, a warehouse from 1918, is now a boutique hotel, concept store and cafe. Across the road,MENYfood supermarket was once a factory for building guns. Because of the building's protected status, MENY had to use the same walls, windows and ceilings as the former World War Two gun factory to create what is now a futuristic food market. Nearby, the raw steel surface ofThe Silostill resembled its days as a grain silo. But it has now been transformed into a luxurious 17-storey residential building with a public restaurant.\n\"The beauty of Nordhavn lies in the blend of old and new architecture standing side by side,\" said Hoffman. \"Sustainability is also about preserving the past by repurposing old buildings for modern use.\"\nNasreen moved to Nordhavn in 2023 and says the calm, car-free environment has transformed her lifestyle. \"I love walking around here,\" she said. \"After living in the city centre for 40 years, not hearing the hums of vehicles is refreshing. The proximity of water to all residential areas gives a sense of peace and fresh air. My nephew is awed by the fact that he can swim in the harbour, walk back home for a shower and then go back to the waterfront to enjoy coffee in a cool café. Isn't that amazing?\"\nShe added: \"I work from home, and when I need a change of scenery, I head to The Audo House. It's a multifunctional space, so you see tourists checking in the hotel and people shopping for art and furniture while I have a coffee in its cafe on a winter afternoon.\"\nIn the early 20th Century, when legendary Danish designer Arne Jacobsen said, \"Architecture is not just about creating buildings; it's about shaping the environment and enhancing people's lives,\" it was theoretical. A century later, Hoffman is leading curious designers and architects like me on walking tours around Nordhavn. As curious as I am, and perhaps with the same intent, they are looking for answers to the question: can architecture be one of the keys to creating a happier urban environment?\nFor Nasreen and many others living in Nordhavn, the answer is a resounding yes.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

They can't be booked in advance, and there's an unwritten rule that the bothy is never full (although groups of six or more and commercial groups are asked not to use them).

Although the grid references are availableonline, don't count on phone signal when looking for them, and even with a well-marked map, they can prove elusive.\nI was hiking a network of trails in an area known as the \"Green Desert of Wales\" because of its lack of settlements, roads and infrastructure. I planned to sleep atNant Syddion bothybefore heading to Aberystwyth, the largest nearby town, the next day. Given the relative scarcity of buildings in the landscape, I'd expected to locate the bothy easily. But climbing up and down a succession of forestry tracks as the sun began to set, I began to wonder if I was going to find it at all.\nWith relief, I finally caught the reflection of a window through the trees and climbed down a steep path to a two-storey stone building that looked like a home transported into the middle of nowhere, complete with a spiral of smoke climbing out of the chimney. And that's exactly what it was. Nant Syddion used to be home to a lead miner and his family and now provides a temporary home for hikers.\nEvery bothy is an adapted building with a previous life. Most are old shepherd's huts, farmsteads or workers' accommodation. In the early 20th Century, hill farming declined and fewer and fewer people lived in remote locations, leaving many buildings derelict. After World War Two, hiking and mountaineering as leisure pursuits dramatically increased in popularity and those exploring the outdoors began using these abandoned buildings as shelters. The MBA was created by Bernard Heath and a group of friends to restore and maintain them for like-minded individuals.\nRemote upland country takes its toll on buildings; the wind and rain age, erode and wear almost everything. However, arriving at the bothy, I found that everything was watertight and functional. Even the gate and the front door had recently been painted.\nKeeping 100 buildings habitable in some of the remotest parts of Britain is no mean feat. When you factor in that this work is all done by volunteers (and where bothies have toilets, it involves carrying the waste out), it's a step beyond altruism. Each bothy has two maintenance organisers, and work parties are organised for any large-scale or structural jobs, which, Neil Stewart, head of communications at the MBA, told me, are rarely lacking in willing hands.\nAlthough they're maintained, bothies are by no means luxurious. You won't find electricity or running water and will be lucky to have a long-drop toilet. Most will have a stove, but there's no guarantee a supply of fuel will be there. Your comforts are carried in, and you should pack as if you're camping, including a tent if the bothy is overcrowded or you don't fancy the company.\nThe company you find in bothies, and the fact that it's completely unpredictable, is one of their unique attractions, according to Phoebe Smith, authorThe Book of the Bothy. \"In a world where everything is bookable and controllable, I love that you can't do that with a bothy,\" she said. \"You just have to go and turn up, and you could have it all to yourself or you could meet some incredible people and share some incredible memories. [Bothies] connect you with other people.\"\nWhen I arrived at Nant Syddion, there were already two cyclists in the main room who were doing an off-road tour of the area. I laid out my roll mat and sleeping bag in the last unoccupied upstairs room and went to join them.\nAfter introducing myself to the cyclists, Alex and Simon, I prepared a quick meal over my gas stove while they battled to get the fire to take. Built to withstand its exposed position, the bothy had thick walls and small windows, so when the light began to disappear, it got dark quickly. We lit a succession of candles and arranged our chairs in a semicircle around the roaring fire.\nOne of the best parts of bothying for me is that people are drawn to socialise together – although you're under no obligation if you want your own space. As we warmed up by the fire, one, then two bottles of whisky (something of a traditional drink for bothies) did the round and stories began to flow. We talked about recent hiking trips in the Dolomites and our bothy experiences, arriving at one to find it full of ex-soldiers in the middle of a reunion drinking session. Hours passed and laughter continued until we remembered we had to hike and cycle back out the next day, and reluctantly left the warmth of the main room to sleep.\nA feature of every bothy is the bothy book, where people record their experiences and motivations for visiting. The next morning, I read through accounts ranging from people sheltering from the rain to alleged supernatural happenings. There was an entry roughly every couple of days, indicating a steady flow of people passing through.\nHowever, it's only been in the last decade and a half that bothies have shifted away from being something of a closed society. In 2009, the locations of the MBA bothies were shared online by the organisation. \"It used to be quite a secretive organisation in the sense that people found out where the bothies were by joining the association or just coming across them in the wilderness areas,\" Stewart explained. \"But that was unsustainable with the internet and people using the outdoors. And it was against our charitable aim. If we're providing buildings for people to use, it's logical we have to tell them where they are, we can't leave them secret.\"\nThis move wasn't unanimously popular. Part of the concern was that the people might begin using these spaces as places to party as opposed to a shelter while enjoying outdoor pursuits. But, as Stewart told me, it's not a problem that's unique to bothies. \"We have had examples of drinking parties in bothies, but we're not particularly bothered with that… There are problems with wild camping in many areas of the country. Up in Scotland, there's a ban on wild camping in one of the national parks because people were littering, leaving rubbish [and] cutting down trees for fires.\"\nMore like this:\n•Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n•The US homes made from waste materials\n•Norway's simple answer to greener, cleaner living\nThe MBA has no way of accurately recording visitor numbers, but anecdotal evidence from their maintenance teams suggests their use has increased with the greater availability of information around them. Smith said, \"There's a whole debate to be had, but the fact of the matter was that bothy users and volunteers, who were fixing them and repairing them, were ageing out and we need younger people coming in.\"\nWhile the locations of the MBA bothies are no longer a mystery, these aren't the only bothies that exist in the UK. There are others, maintained by estates or climbing clubs, where the old system of secrecy endures. As well as the adventure of seeking out hidden bothies whose locations still can't be found online, every bothy experience is unique. With a constantly changing cast of people seeking shelter, the sheer unpredictability is a rare chance in the modern world to embrace serendipity, and that's what inspires me to continue seeking them out.\nHiking out the next morning, I stopped at the bend in the track behind which the bothy would be lost in the trees. It would remain open the next night and the next, for anyone needing shelter, and I thought about all the stories and experiences I'd read through in the bothy book. The MBA network continues to grow and develop. Compostable toilets are being added to more sites, and Stewart shared that two new bothies are currently in the pipeline. That means plenty more stories to come.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "Booking your next holiday? Consider these six trailblazing travel firms making the world a better place",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "This year's Global Responsible Tourism Award winners demonstrate that travel can be inclusive, climate-friendly, nature-positive and a positive force for local communities.\nCelebrating its 20th anniversary this year, theResponsible Tourism Awardsare a standard bearer for the positive side of the travel industry. Run by the non-profit International Centre for Responsible Tourism Global, the awards aim to showcase the benefits of tourism and inspire other firms to do the same.\nAwards like these are particularly important at a time whentourism is under pressure. With global travel and tourism numbersback to pre-pandemic levelsandone in 10 peopleemployed in the industry, the need to improve the sector's environmental, economic and cultural impact is clear. Lifting up businesses that give back to their local communities creates a win-win for tourists and locals alike. And for travellers interested in supporting local culture, having extraordinary nature experiences and a ensuring a responsible travel industry, the winning firms have demonstrated their ability to do that and more.\nTess Longfield, head of sustainability communications at Sabre, who sponsors the awards, commented that extraordinary work is being done by all the winners to create a more sustainable and equitable world through tourism. \"It's a testament to the power of responsible travel to make a real difference,\" she said.\nFrom a private ecolodge in South Africa to a volunteering organisation in a Peruvian biosphere reserve, these are the firms to book with in 2024 and beyond:\nThisfive-star ecolodgeset in 3,500 hectares of South African wilderness is constantly researching pioneering ways of doing things to improve the lives of the local community and protect the fragile landscapes and wildlife that surround it.\nAs well as offering unique tourism experiences to guests, such as guided walks to the flora-richfynbosand coastal safaris in in waters teeming with great white sharks and dolphins, Grootbos' lodge provides ecotourism jobs to the local community. Profits from the lodge fund theGrootbos Foundation, which gives free skills and business training for hundreds of local people in the areas of hospitality, horticulture, entrepreneurship and biodiversity. It creates a ripple effect that's much needed during a period of serious unemployment in South Africa.\nThe judging team called Grootbos \"an exemplary business that others can learn from\", praising the way that it constantly pushes the boundaries and explores new ways of developing responsible tourism.\n\"Grootbos cares about community and conservation,\" said Phil Murray, fundraising, donor relations and communications manager at Grootbos Foundation. \"Neither can be ignored, and both can mutually benefit from programmes and a responsible tourism business that prizes people and planet.\"\nRajasthan Studiocurates art experiences with master artisans in Rajasthan, allowing travellers to experience, understand and value the local culture of the place they are visiting. Travellers can visit master artists at their homes and studios, meet their families, see the process behind making local handicrafts and co-create a personalised souvenir with the crafter.\nThe experiences include an insight into rare and unique art forms like puppetry and the blue pottery of Jaipur,pichwaiart andsea foam carvingof Udaipur, leatherjuttisand tie dye of Jodhpur and much more. The idea is to build a community of artists and scale the business to different parts of Rajasthan, and eventually across India.\n\"Rajasthan as a state is blessed with a wonderful art heritage and travellers are eager to explore every bit of it,\" said company founder Kartik Gaggar. \"But why should we limit it to exploring? We asked the same question and the answer was: let's turn it into an experience.\"\nThe judges were impressed with how Gaggar has created an immersive cultural experience that both economically benefits artists and enriches travellers. They called it a \"highly replicable approach\".\nToday, the company offers more than 20 hand-on art experiences in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur, with plans to include artists from Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Bundi and Kota in the near future.\nAs this year'sprotestshave been demonstrating, tourism has an impact on local people as much as visitors.Sivatel Bangkokwas this year's winner for its innovative approach that brings together local providers to directly help the community.\nThe hotel sources 70% of its ingredients organically and partners with more than 50 local farmers through the Sivatel's Farmer Friends Network. It also supports local producers and fosters a sustainable ecosystem through the \"Sivatel Sustainable Market\", a pop-up market within the hotel where local artisans and food producers can sell their wares to travellers. Uniforms are designed by Folkcharm, a local sustainable fashion brand that supports local artisans.\nPerhaps most uniquely, it runs a \"From Kitchen to Chicken\" programme, diverting hotel food scraps to feed black soldier fly larvae, which are then used as protein for organic chickens at a local chicken farm, where the hotel then sources its meat.\nThe judging panel found Sivatel Bangkok's structured programme based around regenerative agriculture and funding impressive, along with the way it sources and trains local providers.\n\"We believe that to live on this Earth, we cannot live alone but must support each other,\" said Sivatel CEO Alisara Sivayathorn.\nWith a business that serves more than six million holidaymakers a year,TUIis one of the best-known tourism brands in Europe. Its deep and comprehensive commitment to inclusivity impressed the judges: the tour operator has devised a unique way to help those with access needs book their accommodations.\nAmong TUI's many initiatives, they have 90 dedicated agents in their contact centre who have had specialist accessibility training; the team has partnered withAccessAbleto survey hotels and develop detailed access guides; and also works withSign Liveto provide interpreting services for British Sign Language Users.\nMore like this:\n•10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n•What it's like to live in the world's most liveable cities for 2024\n•The Japanese philosophy for a no-waste world\n\"Around one in four of the UK population lives with a disability or condition that impacts their daily life,\" said Marina Snellenberg, TUI's accessibility manager, \"and the prevalence of disability rises sharply with age. It's important that TUI consider the needs and expectations of the disabled community, allowing for a sustained and deliverable customer experience for years to come.\"\nJudges were pleased to see a major tour operator address the needs of those with access needs so comprehensively, and hope that others will follow their example.\nThis award celebrates a small hotel group in Sri Lanka that is actively decarbonising its operations, showing that even smaller players can take meaningful steps towards sustainability and inspire others while doing so.\nIn a tropical climate like Sri Lanka, air conditioning can consume up to 60% of a hotel's energy needs. Across its 19 hotels,Jetwing Hotelsuses renewable energy from biomass, solar PV, solar thermal and biogas for power. In 2023, the hotel group generated the equivalent of the power needed for about 13,490 households through renewable energy alone. The company has also shortened its supply chain, reducing transport emissions, and is now sourcing 40% of their inputs locally to their hotels.\n\"By reducing energy costs and promoting a culture of environmental responsibility among our staff and guests, we ensure that our business practices are not only beneficial for the environment but also economically viable,\" said managing director Dmitri Cooray, \"Our success shows that even the smallest efforts can create a ripple effect, encouraging others to make impactful changes.\"\nThe award founders believe that the travel industry has a responsibility to contribute to the reversal of biodiversity loss and protect nature for future generations by promoting a regenerative approach to tourism.CREES, a Peruvian company offering tours and volunteering opportunities in theManu Biosphere Reserve, is this year's winner of the Nature Positive award.\nThis educational tourism operation is working to benefit local people and conserve biodiversity at its three research stations in theManu National Parkthat are home to one of the longest running and largest biodiversity studies in the Amazon. Guests get to witness conservation efforts first hand, exploring the rainforest in the company of the centre's naturalist guides, and participating in ongoing projects like checking pitfall traps, monitoring birdlife and taking visual surveys of reptiles and amphibians at night. Many of the projects monitor the life of the forest in newly regenerated forest areas, replanted by the team's conservationists, as a way to understand species recovery.\nJudges were particularly impressed by how CREES approaches its work, citing its broad and holistic agenda aimed at promoting sustainable alternatives that respect human rights, intergenerational rights, biodiversity rights and the rights of species to ensure long-term sustainable economic development, as key factors in its win.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevičiusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it withgira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things – it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevičius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevičius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity – particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce – in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known askvassacross north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" saysTomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria – meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics thatbenefit gut healthandimmunity.In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick – consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explainedIeva Šidlaitė, a cultural historian and the author ofNaturally Fermentedwho teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus – like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira isGubernija Breweryin northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\nMore like this:\n•Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n•The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n•A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogailė Čojūtė, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest innon-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinksis soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods ofBeaver Brewing Companyin Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while atHoney'sin East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such asThree Mills Bakeryin the nation’s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK,Northern Monkreleases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says Čojūtė.\nInstead, Eidukevičius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevičius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevičius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "Wismar: The scenic German city that inspired a horror classic",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands.

A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before theWassertorgate inWismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval,Unesco-inscribedcentre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past – the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpieceNosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawlingMarktplatzsquare, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modestHoly Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of Nosferatu to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself,the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024Nosferatufilm, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgård, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up forfour Academy Awardson 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March withHerring Days(15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitorsdidflock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebratedNosferatu's centennialwith creativity and gusto. ABerlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held alakeside production. In the nearby city ofLübeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminatedNosferatu-themed window installationwas displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the city organised guided bat walks and the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-CenturySt George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launchedNosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. AndFestspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinaryopen-air eventand screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselböck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets – it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n•Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n•Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n•Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themedtours of Wismarwith an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends  requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometreself-guided walking tourthat extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of theHanseatic League(a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to aformer Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annualSwedish Festivaleach August.\n\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard thePoeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities. (The Wissemara offers a number of educationalsailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

But her rallying stance – hand outstretched towards Manchester's former Free Trade Hall where she organised the first suffragette meetings that would change the course of British history – remains defiantly unchanged. Further bunches of white flowers, symbolising the purity of the women's suffrage movement and its fight for female political equality, have been tucked at her feet, wilting gently in the spring sunlight that filters through the city's skyscrapers. They are a reminder of the immense progress made in British women's rights since Pankhurst's early 20th-Century campaigns – and, perhaps, of how far there is left to go.\nManchester has long touted its association with the historic struggle for gender parity, yet the city's civic championing of the women who helped shape its progress is muted at best. When Pankhurst's bronze likeness (titled \"Rise Up, Women\") wasunveiled in 2018, it became the first statue of a woman to be erected in a public space in the city since a monument of Queen Victoria was installed inPiccadilly Gardensin 1905. Even now, it is one of onlyfour city-centre statues ofnamedwomen, compared to 18 of men.\nBut a counter-revolution is quietly brewing. I'm visiting the Pankhurst statue as part of a new self-guided walking route, theFeminist Tour of Manchester, which explores little-known stories of its impactful women and historically marginalised LGBTQ+ figures.\nThough the suffragettes naturally feature, it emphasises those who never became household names: for example,Mary Fildes, a trailblazing 19th-Century birth control activist; andEnriqueta Rylands, who founded the Neo-Gothic masterpiece that is theJohn Rylands Library, becoming the first woman to receive honorary Freedom of the City of Manchester. There's a thought-provoking stop at thePeterloo Massacre Memorial(commemorating those who lost their lives in a peaceful working-class protest for parliamentary representation and universal suffrage that turned violent); while the neon jumble of Chinatown's alleyways provides the backdrop to the story of the author and campaigner Alicia Little, whose work highlighted – and eventually helped change – the poor status of women's rights in British marital law.\n\"People have a feeling that there is feminist history in Manchester, but they can't pinpoint what it is,\" says Zakia Moulaoui Guery, founder ofInvisible Cities, the social enterprise behind the tour, which launches this month. \"It's not too late to retrieve those stories or to have more of that representation.\"\nManchester isn't the only city where under-represented women are getting their moment in the spotlight. Across Europe, feminist walking tours that uncover \"forgotten\" stories that have often been preserved in letters and diaries or handed down through word of mouth are gaining popularity. Here are five more tours re-incorporating female legacies into the popular tourist narrative.\nIceland regularly ranks at the top of theWorld Economic Forum's gender gap index, yet the urban planning of its capital, Reykjavík, doesn't necessarily reflect its progressive values. \"We don't even have a statue up of the first female democratically elected president in the world – there's no statue of her anywhere in Reykjavík,\" says resident Tinna Eik Rakelardóttir, referring to Iceland's former president Vigdís Finnbogadóttir.\nInspired by a tour she took in Ljubljana, Eik Rakelardóttir launched theReykjavík Feminist Walking Tour, unpicking 200 years of the nation's drive for gender equality and providing context from her experience as a woman in contemporary Icelandic society. The scenic walk begins in the neighbourhood of Mæðragarður before moving downtown through the capital's manicured squares, concluding at the historic school Kvennskólinn (Reykjavík Women's Gymnasium). Participants learn about Finnbogadóttir – who happened to be Eik Rakelardóttir's neighbour growing up – alongside lesser-known women and marginalised groups whose influence on gender progress she feels should be more publicly visible. After all, she concludes: \"We should know what methods they used and let those stories inspire us.\"\nFrench gender and science researcher Averil Huck first noticed an absence of female representation upon moving to Prague and taking walking tours around the Czech capital, where just5% of street nameshonouring people reference women. She began conducting her own research and launchedPrague Feminist Toursin summer 2023. Her popular tourTo the Roots of Czech Women's Emancipationleads participants through the city's spellbinding historic streets, taking in fabled landmarks such as theCharles Bridge,National TheatreandOld Town Square, while regaling them with the tales of those who fought for access to education, careers and voting rights in the 19th and early 20th Centuries.\nShe has since launched three additional tours, including one held around the festival of Dušičky (All Souls' Day) on 2 November, which takes place in the city'sOlšany Cemeteriesand pays tribute to nine of its most important female historical and cultural figures. \"We stop in front of their graves and light a little candle or leave a flower and I tell the stories of these people,\" says Huck. \"I like to do it in the fall because this cemetery is really overgrown with nature and the colours become beautiful.\"\nCriminals such as Jack the Ripper brought gritty infamy to the streets of London's East End in the 19th Century, yet the neighbourhood has also been home to scores of influential women – notably Mary Wollstonecraft, the writer and philosopher often dubbed Britain's first feminist; or prominent textile designer Anna Maria Garthwaite.Women of London, a tour company founded by Becky Laxton-Bass, spotlights both figures and countless other women who inhabited the vibrant neighbourhood from the 1660s through to the 1940s, analysing how they lived and highlighting the social issues they faced. \"I think it's an area of London lots of people don't really know, so it attracts both locals and tourists,\" says Laxton-Bass.\nMore like this:\n•The female travellers who shaped the ancient world\n•The women porters making history on Peru's Inca Trail\n•In the steps of history's forgotten female explorers\nThe company also runs walking tours ofWestminster and Bloomsbury, unearthing women's stories rarely relayed by traditional tours and crafting a narrative that blends historical and contemporary feminist issues. \"My hope,\" says Laxton-Bass, \"is that people realise that women's history is everywhere.\"\nIn Paris, Julie Marangé launched her first walking tour, focussing on feminist street art, after being disappointed by theFrench reaction to the #MeToo movement. It led to the creation ofFeminists in the City, which now operates in the French capital as well as Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Marseille, and spotlights women through history and culture via walking tours, conferences and masterclasses. Its most popular tour is currentlyThe Witch Hunt, Powerful Women of Paris, which uncovers the powerful women accused of sorcery from the Middle Ages onwards.Anothercentres on female sexual liberation in the lively streets of the Pigalle neighbourhood, delving into the rebellious and subversive feminist roots of the French can-can dance now associated with theMoulin Rougeand the story of the venue's first known female clown, Cha-U-Kao. The tours are extensively researched by Marangé with the help of the historian and women’s rights specialist Claudine Monteil, who was a close friend of the legendary feminist Simone de Beauvoir. \"We're not re-writing history, we are just telling a different story,\" says Marangé. \"It's a different angle, a different perspective; really it's about making women visible in the story of humanity.\"\nAmsterdam's modern feminist history is inherently synonymous with the story of Anne Frank, the Jewish diarist who spent more than two years hidden in a secret annexe in the city alongside her family during World War Two and became one of the most famous victims of the Holocaust. These days, Anne Frank's House receives more than one million visitors annually – but the Dutch capital's gabled canal-front buildings have cultivated plenty of other female legends.\nMany of them are brought to light on Martine Bontjes'Women of Amsterdamtour that loops through the city's historic centre, taking in the work of pioneering figures such as Lijsbeth Vaas, an 18th-Century undercover police officer. Bontjes, whose viewpoint is also inspired by her grandmother's experiences as a woman securing financial independence in post-WW2 Amsterdam, launched her popular tour in 2022 and now runs it every week. \"It's something that so many women are now connected to, since there are so many laws now under pressure,\" she says. \"I believe that this really is the time for women to come together and to share stories.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

So, what should travellers be looking for?\nFourteen Jeeps idle near the dozing lion cubs, burning fuel. The smell of petrol hangs in the morning air as a couple of guides illegally park off-road in Botswana'sChobe National Park, crushing the vegetation so their guests can get a better view. One by one the vehicles pull away towards other animals or to their lodges where their passengers will have lunch – likely flown and driven in from South Africa – before boarding a tiny bush plane themselves.\nGas-guzzling private flights and building mini towns in the remote savannah might seem at odds with one of the industry's most notablemovements: green travel. Yet responsible safaris play an important role in conservation by expanding protected areas, investing in environmental research and creating economic support for local communities. Now, as the pressure of climate change rises, an increasing numbers of travellers are seeking out environmentally and socially ethical safaris that minimise their carbon footprint.According to one reportby B Corp-certified travel advisorGo2Africa, interest in sustainable safaris has grown by more than 1000% over the last four years.\nIn response, many of the continent's largest and most popular safari operators tout carbon-neutral (and even carbon-positive) trips, swapping out traditional Jeeps with electric vehicles, installing fields of solar panels and purchasing carbon credits to make up for their guests' air travel. With them, it's promised, travellers can enjoy a guilt- and carbon footprint-free vacation.\nBut some sustainability experts suggest that these efforts might be a savvy attempt to tap into society's rising climate anxiety, which is at an all-time high according to arecent surveyby the World Economic Forum. At best, safari operators simply know what will grab the attention of eco-conscious travellers.\n\"It's called green-crowding,\" says Judy Kepher-Gona, executive director ofSustainable Travel and Tourism Africa, a consulting company that helps destinations and businesses achieve their sustainability goals. \"Marketers in the tourism industry are smart. If you talk about carbon neutrality, people hear you more than when you talk about sustainability generally. It's easier to understand and, for lack of a better word, sexier – so they crowd around that term.\"\nThe African elephant in the room: is there such a thing as a true carbon-neutral safari?\n\"I suppose that in a spreadsheet it might be possible,\" says Lisa Scriven, general manager ofFair Trade Tourismand Africa Coordinator ofGreen Destinations.\nData manipulation, loopholes and even differing opinions of what defines a \"carbon-neutral\" camp make it difficult to know how strict safari operators are being when they tout the label. For example, Scriven says that some lodges claim to be carbon neutral yet decline to calculate theirScope 3 emissions, which include everything they don't produce. In remote Africa, where every supply, guest, employee and bottle of imported Champagne must travel long distances to reach a private concession in the middle of the Serengeti or Okavango Delta, this cost can quickly skyrocket.\nBoth Kepher-Gona and Scriven also warn against blindly buying into the promise of carbon offsetting, which most carbon-neutral operators include automatically as a levy or offer for a fee to guests. To be effective, reputable carbon-offset programmes should be linked directly to the destination you're visiting and invest in climate justice. When in doubt about the legitimacy of a camp's initiative, Scriven suggests checking with a third-party such asCredible Carbon. In the worst-case scenario, a well-meaning lodge may not purchase their carbon credits wisely; unfortunately, the market hasbecome rifewithscams.\nEven when a safari comes close to carbon neutrality, sustainability experts agree that achieving net-zero carbon emissions alone is not enough to ensure a long-term, eco-friendly future. In fact, it can distract from bigger, more relevant issues.\n\"I think when a business says they're carbon neutral, there's immediate awe,\" says Scriven \"It's not greenwashing because maybe theyarecarbon neutral. But it can be very misleading in terms of thepotential burdenthey're placing on the destination.\"\nGrant Cumings, managing director ofChiawa Safarisin Zambia, agrees. \"Just because a company is climate positive, that does not mean it's taking good care of the wildlife, habitat, local people or the economy of Zambia. All these are just as important – in my view, more important.\"\nThere's good news, however. More responsible safari brands than ever before are reducing their carbon emissions while simultaneously developing multifaceted standards that extend throughout their business.Segera, the founding member ofThe Long Run– a network of nature-based tourism businesses that includes some of Africa's top purpose-driven safaris such asSingita Kruger National ParkandTswalu– defines its commitment through the4Cs framework: conservation, community, culture and commerce.\nOriginally a cattle ranch, the property has transformed into East Africa's largest private conservancy reforestation project and a thriving wildlife sanctuary, with plans to reintroduce critically endangered rhinos in 2025. Located in Laikipia, Kenya, a region known for historic land injustices since the colonial British government pushed the Maasai out in the early 20th Century, Segera prioritises its relationship with neighbouring villages.\n\"Carbon neutrality is one part of sustainability, but we focus a lot more on the community,\" says Joy Juma, programme manager of theZEITZ Foundationthat spearheads Segera's sustainable initiatives. \"We empower them to be part of the value chain by providing employment opportunities, bursaries, education and medical care.\"\nMore like this:\n•How will air pollution change where and when we travel?\n•Could the airship be the answer to sustainable air travel?\n•Is it time to change how we buy travel souvenirs?\nIn addition to community work, conservation is a key standard. Protecting animals from poachers, using environmentally responsible building materials and reducing waste are a starting point, but forward-thinking brands are taking the initiative a step further with transformative biodiversity and environmental management projects. In South Africa,&Beyond Phindaare working on apangolin reintroduction programmewhile workers are creating a critical buffer zone for mountain gorillas at Rwanda'sSingitalodge.\n\nWith so many layered aspects of sustainability to consider, it's understandable that the average traveller might become easily overwhelmed and feel tempted to fall back on a single metric, such as carbon neutrality. To avoid greenwashing, experts suggest choosing a property that's received a recognised, well-regarded sustainability certification – legitimate organisations do independent, on-site audits at least every three years. Dr Andrea Ferry, group sustainability coordinator at Singita, also suggests checking a lodge's website for clear data about their spending on conservation and community projects. Partnering with nonprofits is another good sign.\n\"Lodges that have a high sustainability maturity level are likely to have a separate fund or trust that performs the conservation and community work,\" she says.\nGuests must also be bold enough to ask the right questions prior to booking in order to hold operators accountable, says Kepher-Gona. \"Ask them: what are your sustainability principles? Have the claims that you make been verified by a third party? How do you measure your targets? Where is your last report? What have you done for the local community in the last 30 years?\" A legitimately sustainable property should be proud of their answers. According to Ferry, some lodges are excited to invite guests to view their recycling facilities, rainwater harvesting, solar power system and more.\nAbove all, camps must prioritise accountability and transparency while acknowledging room for improvement and growth. For example, Segera hopes to reduce fuel use and switch to electric vehicles for game viewing, whileSingitais working towards a system to calculate full Scope 3 carbon emissions and better manage water consumption.\n\"Sustainability is multifaceted and it is rare to find perfect solutions,\" says Ferry. \"The more holistically one can think, the better the solution.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "Japan's spectacular bike ride through six remote islands",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu – a custodian Buddhist deity – was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came acrossShimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of theworld's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan'sfirst \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of theworld's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotelAzumi Setodain Ikuchijima Island – a key stop along the way – says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism.Nearly 35 million touristsflocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But asdemand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as theTemple Walk. As I climbed up to the famousSenkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50kmstretchover a single day. I was – quite ambitiously – armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me – and other beginners – Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up toMount Shiratakialong a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island'sSuigun Museumshowcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped fordaifuku(Japanese rice cake) – stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges – at theHassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded asthe origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600mpicturesque main dragselling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda'sKosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town'ssento(public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n•Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n•How the bullet train transformed Japan\n•The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. AtSetoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched ononigiri(rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\nCORRECTION:A previous version of this article incorrectly spelledMukaishima Island.

Now, the world's largest free festival is trying to clean up.\nThe mood is festive as I board the pink and purple Mardi Gras float. Beautiful glass beads hang from hooks lined up above my head while burlap bags full of sustainable \"throws\" – the local moniker for items thrown to parade viewers, including biodegradable glitter and colourful but sustainably packaged beignet mix – sit at my feet. A jaunty brass rendition of the song \"Do whatcha wanna\", a Mardi Gras classic, fills the air as marching bands do quick practice runs of their sets. TheKrewe of Freret, the first Mardi Gras parade to completely outlaw plastic throws, is ready to roll, kicking off a party that is both one of the most beloved and one of the most environmentally damaging festivals in New Orleans.\nThe Mardi Gras revelry in this city is known the world over. New Orleans welcomes millions of visitors during carnival season and more than 50 parades roll down the main streets of St Charles and Canal. Local bars and music venues are packed to the walls with tourists while elaborate Mardi Gras balls and other events meant mostly for locals happen behind closed doors. All in all, nearly$900m in incomecomes from the festivities, according to a recent Economic Impact study – almost 4% of the city's annual revenue.\nThe celebration lasts for more than a month, with \"local\" parades like the dog-themedBarkus, where people dress their furry friends in Mardi Gras costumes and parade them through the French Quarter, rolling as early as three weeks before the final – and most famous – parades on \"Fat Tuesday\". These often include celebrity guests, massive floats and the iconic and ubiquitous plastic beads thrown by the handful into the crowds.\nUnfortunately, all this fun also leads to an equal amount of rubbish. It's estimated that Mardi Gras creates around1,000 tonsof waste every year. In 2018,93,000lb of plastic beadswere found clogging up the city's sewer system, a dire situation in a city that lies partially below sea level and whose sewer systems are needed to keep the city dry. After the parades, rubbish can be knee-deep in the streets, and beads and streamers hang from trees like the Spanish moss native to the area. Though the city's Department of Sanitation does an almost miraculous job of cleaning the streets between parades, refuse still makes its way into the waterways in and around the city, posing a threat to both wildlife and people.\nThis year, however, a coalition of grassroots organisations, and individual \"krewes\", the local groups responsible for putting on the Mardi Gras parades, are attempting a transformation with the help of the city and some supportive sponsors. From massive recycling projects to biodegradable throws, New Orleans is doing its best to clean up its act.\nAccording to a 2020 report by theEcology Center, the plastic used to make Mardi Gras beads is toxic, containing high concentrations of arsenic, chlorine and lead. Further, the report found strong evidence that these beads are made from recyclede-waste, plastic from electronics treated with flame retardants. The sheer volume of beads that end up in the streets and sewers raises fears that these toxins will leach into their surroundings. Indeed, the areas around parade routes have already beenfound to have elevated lead levelsand some of the chemicals found in the beads have been linked toincreased cancer risk.\nFor a city that's both at major risk of flooding and located in what's known asCancer Alley– an 85-mile stretch along the banks of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge where residents have higher rates of cancer due to pollution from nearby petrochemical and manufacturing plants – continuing to throw a massive party that stands to increase the risk of both may seem ill advised. However, the tradition of cheap plastic throws in some ways fuels the entire event.\n\"It is the largest celebration in the world, but who pays for it?\" asked Brett Davis, founding director ofGrounds Krewe, one of the nonprofits spearheading the movement to make the festival more sustainable. \"It's the parading organisations and the krewes themselves. They do it with membership dues, they do it with balls and fundraisers, but more and more over the last 20 years [they do it] by importing huge quantities of cheap parade throws and selling them to all the people in their krewe for like a 600% markup.\"\nAs Davis explains, the cheap beads are sold to locals or visitors who want to climb aboard a float and throw these trinkets to the crowds. And these sales fund the parades themselves, as it's the krewes, not the city, who put on Mardi Gras. A strict rule against any corporate advertising, intended to keep it feeling like a community event, makes it difficult to divest from the practice of selling plastic beads to members as throws.\nAnd there's more at stake than just a free street party. Mardi Gras, and the traditions that take place in and around the festival, are part of the fabric of the city.\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of Mardi Gras in the larger culture of the New Orleans. Media representations of the event often focus on the drunken debauchery of Bourbon Street; however, most of the event is quite family friendly and something the entire city gets involved in. The Uptown parades, which take place on St Charles Avenue during the day, are crowded with children playing and elderly neighbours resting in lawn chairs waiting for the next float to pass by.\n\"Having the perspective of riding on a float and throwing what we're considering just junk beads to a young child… and their face lights up. It just brings tears to your eyes,\" said Linda Baynham, the Director of Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility at the New Orleans Ernest N Morial Convention Center.\nShe says the practice of throwing to the crowd can be meaningful despite the mess it causes. \"I like some beads,\" she added, showing off a small collection of purple, green and gold throws she'd already caught from passing floats that weekend. \"If you get this much from one parade, there's nothing wrong with that. If there's no beads, it gets to be a little disappointing.\"\nIt's easy to see why locals and visitors are hesitant to give up the experience of \"playing catch with a city\", as several float riders put it. There's a community-building aspect to Mardi Gras that's hard to put into words, and for many, losing the traditions and celebrations that make up carnival season would feel like losing a major part of the city's soul. Simply outlawing throws altogether would likely lead to massive pushback from residents.\nFor Suzannah Powell, a producer and performing artist who serves as a sustainability advisor to the Krewe of Freret, part of her job was figuring out that balance between tradition and sustainability when making decisions about what is allowed on the floats and what isn't.\n\"We [still] have those plastic cups, which are everywhere. I'm a member of the plastic pollution coalition and in our ideal world, those things aren't even present. However, I actually advised that we should keep those as an offering because they're culturally such a huge thing,\" she explained. \"They're a sought-after throw and people like to keep them and have different ones across different years. In terms of trying to make a cultural shift, I thought that those cups are specifically a really great example of the bridge that we're crossing. You can't just come in and start swiping everything up with a machete. You have to make concessions for where people are actually at.\"\nSo, what is the solution? Is it possible to make changes that will preserve the important cultural and financial benefits of Mardi Gras while also mitigating the extreme impact it has on the local environment?\nOne of the krewes that marches in the Boehme parade, one of the local parades that rolls through the French Quarter during the earlier part of the carnival season, is the Krewe of Recyclists. The group dresses up as comedic versions of recycling-themed superheroes, including Hans Can-Crusher, played by Kevin Fitzwilliam who is the founder ofAtlas Beads, an organisation that distributes eco-friendly alternatives to plastic beads. Created as a pun based on Hans and Franz from Saturday Night Live, the character crushes cans with his muscles for recycling along the parade route to the amusement of party goers.\nBut New Orleans' recycling heroes are not just fictional characters created for carnival. The coalition of organisations, volunteers and sponsors that make up theRecycle Dat Initiativeare working to help Mardi Gras, and the city of New Orleans, maintain both its traditions and the environment for years to come.\nStarted three years ago by Davis, Recycle Dat began as a handful of local volunteers with small recycling stations set up along the St Charles parade route, but has expanded exponentially since then, offering an alternative to the efficient, but less meticulous clean up done by the Department of Sanitation, which sends everything they capture to the landfill.\nMore like this:\n•How eco-conscious Gen Z are celebrating Holi in India\n•The New Orleans landmark that almost became Napoleon's retirement home\n•A 'crazy town looking to go fossil free': Sweden's wooden city that was green before Greta\nLast year, Recycle Dat collected 4,302lb of aluminium cans, 4,288lb of glass and around 12,697lb of beads and throws. Now with a new larger, more visible set up, they expect those numbers to be even larger. This year, the programme launchedRecycle World, an interactive recycling station on St Charles and Louisiana Avenues where festival goers can drop off their unwanted throws and rubbish, volunteer to help sort cans, bottles and throws for recycling and even participate in an art project created out of recyclable materials gathered on site.\nGrounds Krewe are also instrumental in making sure alternatives to plastic beads are available to krewes during the season. The organisation offers a variety of sustainable throws, including jambalaya mix, soap and biodegradable glitter, to name just a few – all of which can be individually branded according to the krewe's themes.\nFor those still interested in throwing necklaces, Atlas Beads offers handmade creations by a women's collective in Uganda; their beautiful beaded necklaces, bracelets and earrings, lovingly spun from discarded magazine paper, are much more likely to be prized by parade-goers than left behind as rubbish.\nIn the end it's the krewes who decide which throws to use, but even there, a sustainable groundswell seems to be taking hold. This year was the first time that the Krewe of Freret completely outlawed plastic beads from their floats, opting instead to throw glass beads and other more useable items, a move they say garnered massive support from the community.\n\"The reaction [to Freret banning plastic beads] was huge,\" Powell said. \"It actually sent ripples around the city. The [krewe's] website shut down that day because there was so much traffic and this was the biggest year that the Krewe of Freret has ever been. They had to add two additional floats just to accommodate the new members.\"\nNot only did their actions encourage more members to join the Krewe of Freret, the grassroots movement to green carnival may also have inspired one of the largest Mardi Gras krewes, the Krewe of Rex, to experiment with using more sustainable throws, such as stainless-steel cups, wildflower kits and natural fibre tote bags. The Krewe of Rex are known as the \"King of Carnival\" because so many of the Mardi Gras traditions started with them – including the tradition of throwing beads – so their use of sustainable throws this year is a massive sign that things are changing.\nOver two days, traversing the city of New Orleans from Uptown to the French Quarter, everyone I spoke to was thrilled to learn about the efforts to make Mardi Gras more sustainable. One visitor, who described wading through waist-deep debris to retrieve a dropped phone, was particularly enthused. There was also widespread interest, and ideas, regarding potential new kinds of throws, with suggestions ranging from local art to food to books.\nGreen or not, it's clear that no one wants to see the end of Mardi Gras. The question is whether this movement can catch on in time to make an impact on an already beleaguered urban ecosystem. Fitzwilliam believes the artists and activists working on the issue are on track to make it happen in classic New Orleans style: \"Garnering support for a more environmentally friendly Mardi Gras is best accomplished by simply having more fun than the other side.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "Kek lapis: The most beautiful cake for Ramadan",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n": "The cake is a sublime art form, involving numerous colours and flavours commingling into an oh-so-soft and delicious cake that hides a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\nThe rich, buttery aroma ofkek lapis(layer cake) greets me when I walk into Seri's (short for Sharifah Zainon)small baking studioat her home near Kuala Lumpur. The alluring aroma is not surprising, given that Malaysia is gearing up to celebrate Raya, which is short for Hari Raya (the Day of Celebration in Malay), and refers to the festive occasion marking the end of Ramadan. Kek lapis is an integral part of these festivities.\nSeri puts her academic training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker. Watching her hands spreading the batter evenly on the pan, I think that baking a kek lapis is a bit like conducting a scientific experiment. Preparing this multi-layered Malaysian cake with colourful and complex patterns not only requires knowledge and skill, but also oodles of patience, an eye for precision and a steady hand.\nA degree in the sciences seems to come in handy for kek lapis bakers, seeing the elaborate designs thatKaren Chai, another engineer turned baker, creates at her baking studio in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb. When Chai returned to Malaysia after studying pastry arts atLe Cordon Bleuin Paris, she decided to focus on kek lapis, using her mother's recipe as a starting point. \"Learning about the science of baking has been very useful in making kek lapis,\" she said.\nThis layer cake first came to Malaysia from neighbouring Indonesia through thestate of Sarawakon the island of Borneo. In the mid-19th Century, Dutch colonisers introduced the plain European spit cake – made with layers of dough deposited one by one onto a cylindrical rotating spit – to the nation then known as Batavia (now Jakarta). Indonesians added local spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg and turned it into thelapis legit, often known as the thousand-layer cake.\nUpon its arrival in neighbouring Malaysia in the 1970s, Sarawakians elevated the cake to a sublime art form, involving multiple layers and numerous colours and flavours commingling into the oh-so-soft and delicious kek lapis. While the classic kek lapis often looks like a plain loaf on the outside, cutting it reveals a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\nAlso called the Sarawak layer cake, kek lapis typically has a minimum of 12 layers. The cake is created by carefully adding one thin layer of batter after another onto a baking pan every few minutes, broiling (or grilling) each layer in the oven to ensure the lower layers are never burnt. The plain version alternates light and dark strips of cake batter,whereas the coloured cakes have geometric patterns that, depending on the final pattern, can involve 20 or more layers.\nThe final cake is cooled and then cut into strips, with different pieces reassembled using thick jam or condensed milk as adhesive. Often, multiple cakes have to be baked, and pieces from each of them are assembled to create a complex pattern. This is then wrapped up in a thin cake layer of a single colour, or arranged between two sets of plain (ie, with no colours or patterns) multi-layered cakes.\nIf all this sounds confusing, then imagine what it is like for the baker. Even the most experienced of them first draws these patterns on paper, clearly marking out sizes and colours, after which they get to work with the batter. A complex design can take up to eight hours to complete, with several chances for error at every step in the assembly process.\nChai explains that as opposed to other complex layered cakes, it is particularly tough with kek lapis, since the error often becomes apparent only after the baker has finished assembling the pieces, \"so all the hard work goes down the drain\".\nShe then shows me photos of her mother's signature 16-piece design that was born out of an error in calculation. \"She baked a few extra layers by mistake and didn't want to throw those pieces away. She just cut that up and tried to form another block, and this design came out. So this is not something that you will find from other bakers,\" she said.\nBoth Seri and Chai say that the long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of seeing a perfectly executed design. \"But there are no short cuts,\" Chai warned. Indeed, seeing Seri at work, cutting and sticking these long strips together with a generous lashing of raspberry jam, brings to mind a complicated jigsaw puzzle slowly taking shape. \"It's like therapy, [but] it's also fun and creative\" she said.\nWhen I visited in mid-February, the bakers had been working non-stop for weeks, fulfilling Raya orders received through their social media channels. Back in their hometowns in Sarawak, kek lapis is part of every holiday celebration, including Chinese New Year, Raya, Christmas and the midyear harvest festival of Gawai Dayak, cutting across communal and religious boundaries.\nSeri's long-term client and self-professed cake lover, Farazaila Wahet, said, \"This is an anytime cake for me, but of course for Raya, it is a must.\" The Sarawak native, who moved to Kuala Lumpur more than 10 years ago, said that the satisfaction she gets from kek lapis is unparalleled, because \"the texture is heavier and the taste is richer compared to any other cake.\"\nKek lapis is available in many flavours, such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, red velvet and pandan (a tropical plant with a strong aroma, commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking). Even popular malted drinks like Horlicks and Milo are used for flavouring. And now, artisanal bakers like Seri and Chai are trying to modernise this traditional cake to make it relevant to younger generations, while also staying true to the original recipe.\nSeri, for instance, makes exquisite chocolate batik art on the top layer to make her cakes even more attractive. \"Batik is traditional to Malaysia, so is kek lapis, and I love to combine the two to create this new version,\" she said.\nMore like this:\n•A multi-layered cake from India\n•Norway's best cake\n•The centuries-old baba made with 96 egg yolks\nChai keeps experimenting not just with more complicated patterns, but also new ingredients and flavour pairings. In the past, she has created gluten-free kek lapis using coconut flour with peanut butter topping, and another unique version with fig, apricot and cinnamon.\nBaking a good kek lapis requires a lot of time and high-quality ingredients, which means that they are also expensive, with prices going up to RM300 (roughly £50) or more for a square, one-kilogram cake. But thankfully for the small-batch bakers, this traditional cake is constantly in demand from individual clients and it's also gaining in popularity as corporate gifts and wedding favours.\nThese bakers are on a mission to maintain this Sarawak culinary tradition, despite all the long hours and thin margins. As Seri said, \"Every time I make a kek lapis, it feels like a piece of home to me.\"\nBBC.com'sWorld's Table\"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n---\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us onFacebook, or follow us onTwitterandInstagram.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\n"

In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cookjaprakë, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\nJaprakë holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in thisreligiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one ofEurope's youngest-aged countrieshow to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991,Albaniawas ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s,710,000 citizens– 20% of the population – fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine – except for women of a certain age.\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those whodidrecall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes likeArnavut ciğeri(Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, whilesutlijaš(rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes likeajvar(a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\nSome indigenous foods, likemishavinë(a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes includeflia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, andbyrek me mish, aTurkish-style boreklaced with paprika.\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee inAlbania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish washalva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan,Lailatal Qadr.\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes liketavëkrapi(a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", likelakror me arra(an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\nXhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant,Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\nXhahysa's recipe offërgesë(a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop ofgjizë(a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania’s forgotten past.\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs,Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages atLe Gavrochein London andnomain Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurantMullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\nMore like this:\n•The Peak of the Balkans Trail: Europe's last true wilderness\n•A new 5,500km bike trail connecting one of Europe's most remote regions\n•Kukës: The first city ever nominated for a Nobel Prize\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant inGjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods – many sourced from grandmothers – is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what René [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

How is it that just 20 minutes ago, the skies were grey and moody with the threat of an imminent downpour? In Sri Lanka's central highlands, the weather may be capricious but what remains unchanged is the sprawling expanse of tea estates in every direction.\nThis region is where the bulk of soothingCeylon teacomes from. And the recently openedPekoe Trail, Sri Lanka's first long-distance hiking trail that runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history. This hiking trail, divided into 22 stages, begins in Sri Lanka's second largest city of Kandy, close to the area where Scotsman James Taylor first planted tea in the country in the mid-1800s. After a long and circuitous route, it finally ends in the hill town of Nuwara Eliya, whose cool climes and misty slopes are said to have reminded the British colonisers ofBlighty(Britain).\nThe trail has existed in patches since those initial days of tea cultivation in Sri Lanka, beginning as basic mud tracks that were used to transport the leaves to factories and then onward to domestic markets and Colombo port for export. For Pekoe Trail founder and sustainable tourism consultant Miguel Cunat, creating this multi-stage, multi-day hike was a labour of love, involving nearly 10 years of research and exploration.\n\"My initial objective was to promote Sri Lanka as a world-class hiking destination,\" says the Spaniard and long-time Sri Lanka resident, who was keen to put the small island back on the tourism map after a disastrous spell with Covid and the subsequenteconomic crisis. His efforts came to fruition with the official opening of the Pekoe Trail in late 2023, with initial funding from the European Union andUSAID.\n\"The trails are fairly easy, at low elevation and open all through the year. In that sense, this hike is for everyone,\" he explains. That means everyone, including novice hikers such as myself, have the option to stay in a hotel near the trail and go out on exploratory day hikes within a single stage. I also come to understand later from my trail guides that most visitors choose to do this instead of attempting the trail in its entirety.\nAnd although tea is the common thread stitching this story together, each stage has its own unique elements – a colonial-era cricket club here, a seasonal waterfall there, statues of brightly coloured village deities, Anglican churches with brilliant stained-glass windows, distant views of a sharp peak or clusters of wildflowers blooming in the midst of a barren stretch. Cathy Cruse, a 62-year-old Australian hiker who recently set a record by completing the entire trail in seven days, agrees, saying, \"You've got the tea plantations and then you're going into thick jungle and then pine forests, and then at one stage I thought I was walking through Australia, with all the tall eucalyptus trees.\"\nCunat's objective was also to bring tourist attention and money into the hinterlands and hill towns located away from the popular coastal destinations of Sri Lanka's south or the Buddhist Cultural Triangle ofAnuradhapura,Sigiriyaand Dambulla. Cruse, who is married to a Sri Lankan, says that she has visited Kandy and Nuwara Eliya several times but never had a chance – or indeed, a reason – to explore the more interior parts of the tea country.\nAs Cunat walked along the various trails, he also began to see a larger picture emerging from the network of villages and communities along the way. \"Along with nature, there is so much history and living heritage, with local fairs and festivals, and opportunities to see how [rural Sri Lankans] live and work,\" he says. And it is this aspect I most enjoy about my hikes – I am never too far from civilisation, be it a local temple or a tea factory, and I get to have regular interactions with friendly plantation workers and curious children everywhere. It is perhaps why Cruse stresses how safe the trail is for solo or women hikers. \"When I pick a trail, I'm looking for somewhere safe that a woman can tackle on her own and not feel intimidated. Not once did I ever feel nervous of my surroundings or my guides on the Pekoe Trail,\" she says.\nThe history of tea in Sri Lanka is inextricably linked with theIndian-Tamil plantation workersbrought by the British. Their descendants – mostly women – still form the backbone of the lowest levels of tea production. Dressed in frayed button-down shirts and thick long skirts to protect from leeches, they spend their lives picking the finest leaves from the bushes. I see them walking up and down the tea estates, their hands nimble with years of practice, their necks bent with the load of the bamboo baskets tied to their heads, into which they carefully toss the leaves.\nThe women beam in delight when I speak to them in Tamil. \"Tell me about India,\" third-generation tea picker Sathyavathy demands, when I stop to chat with her group during their mid-morning tea break in the Bogawantalawa area, known as the \"Golden Valley\" due to its fine quality of tea. \"Is it beautiful?\" Like many of her peers, she has distant family back in the small towns of Tamil Nadu in South India but has never visited the country.\nMy initial hikes take me through stages seven and eight near Hatton in the heart of the tea country, dotted with old factories that still process tea using dated technology, and boutique hotels repurposed from massive bungalows once meant for estate managers. My guide here is Dharsharuban Rathnasingham, a young man whose grandparents and mother used to work in these very tea plantations.\nMore like this:\n•The rise of the slow swimming holiday\n•A hike through history on Britain's oldest road\n•Sri Lanka's most beautiful train journey\nRuban – as he likes being called – is passionate about sharing the stories of his people, Indian Tamils who populate the villages and towns around the various stages of the Pekoe Trail. As we walk, he stops to point out the elements distinctive to tea plantation life, like the \"line rooms\", cramped barrack-style quarters where large families lived together (and still do, in some places); and the statues of fierce Tamil protector deities placed at major crossroads or beneath trees, often depicted riding a horse or wielding a scythe.\nFrom Hatton, I take thefamed Colombo to Badulla trainto Ella, from where I attempt to tackle stages 15 and 16 over the next several days, taking in the viewpoint known as Ella Rock and the picturesque nine-arch railway bridge. Here, the tea goes in and out of view, with some stretches taking me over active railway tracks and others on paths shaded by tall eucalyptus and pine trees. The Pekoe Trail may be long and even tough in parts, but it is never boring or monotonous.\nAs Cruse says, \"There were just so many 'wow' moments during the hike, where you come around a corner, and the whole valley would just be laid out below and I would have to stop and just stare.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

    "A second chance for Malta's paradise island turned 'hell on Earth'": "The US island that speaks Elizabethan English",
    "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations.

The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980.

I've spent a good part of my life in the state, but I'm still learning how to speak theHoi Toiderbrogue. The people here just have their own way of speaking: it's like someone took Elizabethan English, sprinkled in some Irish tones and 1700s Scottish accents, then mixed it all up with pirate slang. But the Hoi Toider dialect is more than a dialect. It's also a culture, one that's slowly fading away. With each generation, fewer people play meehonkey, cook the traditional foods or know what it is to be \"mommucked\".\nIn an effort to put his \"America first\" stamp on the nation's speech, US President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order makingEnglish the country's official language. It marks the first time in the US's nearly 250-year history that the nation has had an official language. Yet, on this small 9.6-square-mile island surrounded by the swirling waters of the Atlantic, residents still speak what is arguably the most English version of English in the country – and many Americans don't understand it.\nAs the island'sofficial websiteproudly proclaims: \"With origins dating back to the 1600s, Ocracoke brogue is about as American as it gets.\"\nLocated 20 miles from the North Carolina mainland, Ocracoke Island is fairly isolated. You can't drive there as there are no bridges, and most people can’t fly either as there are no commercial flights. If you want to go there, it has to be by boat. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, that meant Ocracoke was a perfect spot for pirates to hide, as no soldiers were going to search 16 miles of remote beaches and forests for wanted men.\nWilliam Howard was one of those outlaws, serving as quartermaster on Blackbeard’s ship Queen Anne’s Revenge. Leaving before Blackbeard’s final battle in 1718, Howard made his way to Virginia, eventually taking the general pardon offered by King George I to all pirates. But unlike some, Howard had a plan. For several decades, he dropped out of sight, only to reappear in 1759 when he bought Ocracoke Island for £105 from a man named Richard Sanderson, a justice and later a General Assembly member in mainland North Carolina.\nHoward settled down along with some other ex-pirates and started building a community with boat pilots who had been stationed on the island to help guide merchant ships around sandbars in the area. A mainland North Carolina Native American tribe also interacted with the early settlers. The Woccon tribe had set up fishing and hunting outposts on the island, which they called Woccocock. Through misspellings and mispronunciations, it became Wokokon, Oakacock and Okercock, before finally arriving at the current version of Ocracoke in the mid-1700s. So at this point, there were Native Americans, English sailors and pirates from a variety of places all in one location. And that isolated community of just under 200 started blending words and dialects, and eventually building its own way of speaking.\n\"It's the only American dialect that is not identified as American,\" said Dr Walt Wolfram, a North Carolina State University professor who studied the Ocracoke dialect for more than 20 years and currently works as the director of NC State’sLanguage and Life Project. \"That's fascinating to me. You can find pronunciation, grammar structures and vocabulary on Ocracoke that are not found anywhere else in North America.\"\nHoward's community lived in near-isolation for almost two centuries. Electricity didn't arrive at the island until 1938 and a ferry service didn't start until 1957, leaving the islanders cut off except for the occasional supply trip to the mainland. Even today, things are a bit different for the island's676 residentsthan on mainland North Carolina.\n\"You have to be a certain type of individual to enjoy living here,\" said Chip Stevens, an island resident directly descended from Howard and the former owner of the local hotelBlackbeard's Lodge. \"There isn't a Lowes or a Harris Teeter or any [supermarkets]. Rarely does anyone go off the island without a cooler [to bring back supplies]. You have to be almost a holistic person, capable of dealing with less of a hectic nightlife lifestyle.\"\nYes, mobile phones and laptops still work here, and if you want to sit down and watch some Major League Baseball in a pub, there are plenty of options. But in many other ways, the island is a throwback to a time before internet and television. Instead of cinemas, there are outdoor theatre groups. Local teashops, spice markets and other family-owned stores take the place of chain supermarkets. Cars are allowed on the 16 mile-long island, but most people just park them and walk everywhere. The island's children all attend one school, while residents work as everything from fishermen to brewery owners to woodworkers.\n\"It's amazing how coming across that ferry is almost like going to a different country,\" Stevens said, sitting on the hotel's front porch. \"You feel that separation. It's a really nice feeling, being able to give your kids some freedom. When I was a kid, we'd leave [home] after breakfast, eat lunch at somebody else's house, walk to the beach, take a rowboat out in the water, and our parents never had to worry about us. We've maintained a lot of that.\"\nAnd they've still – just – maintained their unique way of speaking.\nWhen older Ocracoke natives, or \"O'cockers\" as they call themselves, speak, the \"I\" sound is an \"oi\", so they say \"hoi\" instead of \"high\". That's where the Hoi Toider name comes from: it's based on how the O'cockers say \"high tide\".\nThen there are the phrases and vocabulary, many of which are also kept over from the original British and Irish settlers. For example, when you're on Ocracoke, someone might \"mommuck a buck before going up the beach\", which means \"to tease a friend before going off the island\".\n\"We have a lot of words that have been morphed to make our own,\" said Amy Howard, another of William Howard's descendants, who runs theVillage Craftsmen, a local arts and crafts store. \"[Hoi Toider] is a combination from a whole blend of cultures. A lot of the early settlers were well travelled, so they ran into lots of different types of people. For example, the word \"pizer\" we use comes from [a European] word which means porch. So if you're going to be sitting on your pizer, you're sitting on your porch.\"\nThere's a long list of words in Ocracoke vocabulary that are taken from countries across the globe. \"Quamish\", for example, means sick or nauseated. It comes from the 16th-Century English word \"qualm\". Then there's \"buck\", which means a male friend. You can trace that back to 13th-Century Germany, where it originally meant a male deer, as it does in most English-speaking places today.\nLocals even made up words in some cases. For example, early settler children played a game of hide and seek called meehonkey. Everyone would hide and call out \"meehonkey\" while one person tried to find them. According to island tradition, Amy told me, the kids believed meehonkey was the sound a goose made as it flew by. Then there's \"dingbatter\", which is used for anyone who isn’t a native.\nBut with each generation, the dialect is starting to disappear. The world is coming to the island through television and the internet, as well as with the long line of tourists who show up every summer. There's also more people from the mainland moving in.\n\"What's happening is that some of these small dialects that thrive on isolation are dying because isolation is a thing of the past,\" said Dr Wolfram. \"They still pick up terms and vocabulary, but when a kid from the island retains a strong dialect, that was the norm and now it’s an exception.\"\nMore like this:\n•The Alabama musuem grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n•How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n•The only land disputed between the US and Canada\nIn the past, kids adopted the dialect because that was the only version they heard. Now there are hundreds of dialects and languages that most will encounter before they graduate high school. In fact, as of 2024, on this island of 676 people, fewer than half actually speak with the full Hoi Toider brogue.\n\"Within one to two generations, it'll be gone,\" said Dr Wolfram. \"It's dying out and we can’t stop that.\"\nYet while the dialect may be in danger, the islanders are managing to hold onto their unique culture in other ways. In the beginning, settlers often had to come up with alternatives when they didn't have the right ingredients for a recipe. That same concept holds true today: with limited stores on the island, if you run out of supplies, you can either head to the mainland for what you need or just find a replacement.\n\"Ocracoke is really good at adapting,\" said Amy. \"I joke that we need to make a cookbook for Ocracoke that says what the recipe is and then what you can actually get, because almost inevitably, you get a quirky recipe and you won’t have everything you need.\"\nThat's actually how the fig cake, which is now Ocracoke's signature dish, came to be. The story goes that in 1964, island resident Margaret Garrish was making a date cake and she had all the ingredients mixed in, except one.\n\"She found she didn't have any [dates], so she did what we all do and looked in her cupboard and found a jar of fig preserves,\" Amy said, explaining that figs are a holdover from the original settlers, and you can find fig trees in almost every yard. \"She threw them in the cake, mixed them up and now we have fig cakes.\"\nNow every year in August, the island holds aFig Festival, complete with a fig cake bake-off, fig tastings, a square dance and traditional games like meehonkey.\nBut while some traditions stand strong, residents do see the island changing.\nNew York native Daphne Bennink came to the island 35 years ago and never left. For her, the change, in some ways, reflects the same wealth of experience those original settlers brought.\n\"I see more and more people coming here,\" Bennink said. \"On Ocracoke, you have this kind of patchwork quilt of all people from all walks. It’s a little bit of a melting pot.\"\nAs for what type of culture that melting pot will create? Everyone I talked to pretty much said the same thing: no matter what changes, some things will stay the same on Ocracoke. If someone is sick, the community will pitch in. If one business owner needs help, 14 others will show up to solve the problem. The dialect may change, but the intent behind those words will remain the same.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"

Here are her picks for enjoying the Eternal City with kids.\nIf there's one thing as eternal as Rome, it's the familial bonds that have breathed life into the city over the centuries. For Rome-born celebrity chefGiada de Laurentiis, these cherished childhood memories in the Eternal City have also fuelled her career.\n\"Rome really is home,\" says de Laurentiis, who emigrated to the United States with her family when she was seven years old. \"All of my earliest memories are in Italy, mainly \"[centred on] family and food.\"\nDe Laurentiis may have built her culinary empire on the sunny shores of southern California but she has never lost ties to the city of her birth, visiting once or twice a year. Her relationship with her Roman roots, nevertheless, wasn't always an easy one.\n\"As a kid, it was the bane of my existence,\" says de Laurentiis. \"Everyone made fun of the pasta I had in my lunches, the way my name sounded, the list goes on.\"\nWith time, however, she came to see her Roman heritage as an invaluable asset – a \"superpower\", as she calls it. She describes feeling connected to Italian culture as the \"joy of life\", something she has tried to pass on to her daughter, Jade. \"I think her Italian roots have served as a really beautiful anchor for her,\" says de Laurentiis.\nBut now, and especially as the2025 Jubileepropels Rome even further into the limelight, she hopes for others to taste the true beauty of Italian family life – especially the new generation.\nRome can prove overwhelming for children; the crowds are large, the landmarks daunting in size and in sheer quantity. But with the right approach it can be a magical experience, one that they cherish and share with their own families – as de Laurentiis loves doing with hers.\nHere are de Laurentiis' favourite family-friendly ways to experience the Eternal City.\nFew places bring a family together like Campo de' Fiori, a vibrant street market tucked behind Piazza Navona that has something for just about everyone. Originally established as a flower market in the late 19th Century, Campo de' Fiori has been supplying locals and tourists of all ages with everything from fresh flowers and food to kitschy trinkets and souvenirs for more than 150 years.\nAnd just behind Campo de' Fiori is the historicAntico Forno Roscioli, serving one of de Laurentiis' favourite family-friendly treats: pizza. Opened in 1972, with lines sometimes stretching deep into the piazza, the bakery is a local institution, favoured by locals and gourmets alike. Their pizza is a masterclass in Roman baking tradition, made with little yeast and left to rise for 24 hours, resulting in dough that is light, crispy and, in de Laurentiis' words, quite simply \"great\".\n\"Roman-style pizza is really fun for kids to try,\" she says. Servedal taglio(by the slice), Roman pizza is thinner and crispier than the puffy-crusted Neapolitan pizza widely recognised outside of Italy. But the pizza al taglio at Roscioli has its own flair: \"It's like a focaccia type of dough and they sell it in squares,\" says de Laurentiis. \"I love the potato and onion slices.\"\nWebsite:https://www.anticofornoroscioli.it/\nAddress: Via dei Chiavari 34, 00186\nTelephone: +39 66864045\nInstagram:@anticofornoroscioli\nCompleted in 1762 under the design of Baroque mastermind Nicola Salvi, the sumptuousTrevi Fountainhas become an emblematic part of Rome's architectural iconography.\nIts international renown – bolstered by appearances in silver screen classics ranging from La Dolce Vita to Roman Holiday – is such that, last autumn, exasperated city councillors consideredticketing visitorsto curb the inflow following a heated debate on the havoc overtourism is wreaking on the Italian capital.\nThe gargantuan crowds might prove intimidating for the younger ones, but its appeal for children in particular is not to be underestimated.\n\"[It's] fun because the kids get involved in history (and they get to play with money),\" de Laurentiis says, referencing the tradition of tossing coins into the fountain to ensure one's return to Rome.\nThere's also much more to Trevi than meets the eye.\n\"You can go below the Trevi Fountain. It's honestly amazing,\" de Laurentiis says. Indeed, beneath the monument is\"the City of Water\"– a hidden maze, an ancient Roman apartment complex dating to the 1st Century CE called the Vicus Caprarius, as well as the aqueduct that funnels water into the fountain itself.\nWebsite:https://www.vicuscaprarius.com/visite/\nAddress: Vicolo del Puttarello, 25\nInstagram:@vicuscaprarius\nCooking is the glue that brings Italian families together – as soon as the garlic starts sizzling in the morning, the tone is set for the rest of the day.\n\"My childhood taught me the art of gathering,\" says de Laurentiis, whose upcoming cookbook Super-Italian is a meditation on superfoods and healthful lifestyles. \"It exposed me to amazing ingredients from a really young age, which taught me the beauty in simple, well-made dishes.\"\nSo what better way to experience Italian family life than taking a cooking class with your kids?\nDe Laurentiis recommends classes offered byKatie Parla, an Italian-American tour guide and food writer who has lived in Rome for 20 years; andSophie Minchilli, a Rome-born and bred author and influencer.\n\"Kids get to be really involved with the process,\" de Laurentiis says. \"[Katie and Sophie] have both have lived in Rome for decades. Sophie was born in Italy and Katie is a true Roman historian.\"\nParla'sdeeply insider approach to Romeoffers both a tour of themain market feeding Rome's residents– theMercato Trionfalenear the Vatican – as well as athree- to four-hour cooking classwith chef Arianna Pasquini, held in the leafy Monteverde neighbourhood and culminating in a five-course meal.\nMinchilli, on the other hand, provides a tailor-made,intimate tourwith up to six people, taking clients on what she describes as a \"walk around the city with a friend\", exploring its best foodie spots as well as offering customised visits upon request.\n\"Both give you access to Italian culture in a really impactful way,\" says de Laurentiis.\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find a kid who doesn't love chocolate, and at Venchi, any kind of sugar craving can be abundantly satisfied.\nThe chocolatier – founded in the northern Italian city of Turin in 1878 – has become a vital stop for anyone with a sweet tooth, which de Laurentiis openly confesses to have.\n\"Anyone who knows me knows chocolate is my weakness,\" says de Laurentiis. \"I've tried it all, and Venchi is one of my faves.\"\nDe Laurentiis notes how children will particularly delight over its two main showstoppers: \"the chocolate fountain and gelato\".\nWith a plethora of delicacies, from crepes to hazelnut ice cream, all of which can be topped with different kinds of melted chocolate (and a complimentary treat), it's the perfect afternoon stop for a bit of mid-sightseeing indulgence.\nAnd with three stores across the city centre, you don't have to venture far from the main landmarks to get a hold on their delicacies: there's onenear the Trevi Fountain, one a stone's throwfrom the Spanish Stepsand another justbehind the Pantheon.\nWebsite:Venchi Cioccolato e Gelato, Roma Via del Corso - Venchi\nAddress:\n1.

The city's seagulls, appearing most commonly in the city's piazzas and parks at night, are a clear (and occasionally aggressive) reminder.\nCrystalline waters, white-sand beaches and lush Mediterranean woodland can be found at the picturesqueLido di Castel Fusano, an unspoilt stretch of coastline that has a particular sentimental value for de Laurentiis.\n\"Lido di Castel Fusano is a favourite,” she says. \"When I was a kid, we loved to go to the beach for the day. It's so nostalgic, packing lunch and driving to the beach with my family.\"\nThere is no more quintessentially Roman family experience than prepping a few hearty snacks and aninsalata di riso(rice salad) in a thermal bag, grabbing the car and heading to the beach for a lazy afternoon, especially as short-lived winters give way to months of endless sunshine.\nAnd at a mere 30km from the city (accessible by a 55-minute train ride on the Metromare from Rome's Porta San Paolo station), Lido di Castel Fusano is easily reachable and a welcome distraction from the Eternal City's heady chaos, especially for the little ones. \"It's just such a nice break from the bustle of Rome,\" de Laurentiis says.\nWhile Lido di Castel Fusano's beaches are most popular in the summer months, there's a year-round joy to be taken from strolling along the shore, horseback riding in the surf or getting lost in its 916-hectare pine forest.\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram.\n"
